This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[section="OpenMP"]Support for OpenMP[/section]
Wesnoth now has experimental support for OpenMP to better use multiple cores. This needs to be enabled at compile time.

OpenMP has been tested under linux and windows but needs some testing under MacO, which is why it is currently optional.
In particular we are interested in abnormal CPU usage when openMP is enabled. Please report to Boucman for debug instructions

[section="Khalifate"]New MP Faction: Khalifate[/section]
A new multiplayer faction is included in the multiplayer era default+Khalifate.  Note that this does not in any way change the current default era!  Khalifate units are lawful and have unique movetypes and resists.  To use this faction simply choose the "default+Khalifate" era from the multiplayer game launch options.

The Khalifate are very much a work in progress.  They are fully playable but are still lacking unit descriptions some aesthetic components such as attack animations.  Expect to see many changes and much improvement of these guys in future releases!  There is not currently any campaign that uses Khalifate units, but they are fully available for use in campaigns and scenarios so any motivated individuals can be the first to write one!

You can give feedback and report problems in the [url=http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=33782]Khalifate feedback thread[/url].
