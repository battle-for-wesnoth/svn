This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

***

The new message dialogs had quite some bug fixes, but there are still some
left. The but that terminated Wesnoth when showing certain dialogs should be
fixed. Please report if you still find this bug or other bugs not in the
tracker yet. (Filter for the ones assigned to mordante.)

***

Rewritten a part of the render code of terrains which should fix the problem
that some units are shown over the background terrain. There are some issues
left with mountains since some parts which should be background terrain are
foreground terrain. Also a lot of other minor redraw glitches have been fixed
in this release.
