This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

The add-ons directory, <preferences>/data/campaigns, has been renamed
to <preferences>/data/add-ons in order to better reflect its current
purpose: holding not only singleplayer campaigns, but also any other
kinds of single or multiplayer add-ons.

***

A new campaign has found its place in mainline after being cared for by
the Wesnoth-UMC-Dev Project for polishing and bug-fixing. It is
Delfador's Memoirs, a novice level campaign with 24 scenarios, some of
which are brand-new; other scenarios were actually cut from the original
Legend of Wesmere before the latter was added to mainline.
