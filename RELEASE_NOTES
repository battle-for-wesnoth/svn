This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here.

The release team should empty this file after each release.


terrain_mask maps which are stored in a separate file should use the extension
'.mask' instead of '.map'. This way wmllint can properly convert the maps to
the new format. Obviously this should be done before running wmllint on the
data.
