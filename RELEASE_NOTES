This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

A new campaign has entered mainline after being hosted by the
Wesnoth-UMC-Dev Project for a few months. It is Dead Water, an
intermediate level merfolk campaign with 13 scenarios.

***

On X11 systems, Battle for Wesnoth now respects the XDG base directory
specification when storing files into the home directory. In particular,
unless some custom configuration from the user or the desktop environment
is in use, config files will be found in ~/.config/wesnoth, save files
and add-ons will be found in ~/.local/share/wesnoth/<version>, and cache
files will be found in ~/.cache/wesnoth.
