This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)

The release team should empty this file after each release.

Since Tiny-GUI, a system that scaled images down at install time to a smaller size and display those things ingame, was utterly broken, it was removed from the game. Because of this, for the moment there will be no support for resolutions below 800x480. Before, you had to compile a specific binary for this size as well as convert all images; this is no longer possible. Resolutions below 800x480 might eventually be supported again after the move to GUI2 is completed and we get OpenGL(ES) support, since then defining a smaller GUI should be possible more easily and zooming should almost come for free. When starting Wesnoth without any parameters the minimum resolution is now 800x480 instead of 800x600.

***

The option to build without the editor has been removed. The editor is now always built into the game.
