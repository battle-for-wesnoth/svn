This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)

The release team should empty this file after each release.

***

Various additional game interface dialogs have been converted to the new GUI2 toolkit in this release.

[list]
[*]Every yes/no confirmation dialog, except for the add-ons dependencies resolution window.
[*]The gamemap labels editor dialog.
[*]The following list-type dialogs: display resolution (Preferences), theme selection (Preferences), remove add-ons (Add-ons) scenario selection (Debug :cl), campaign difficulty selection (Campaigns).
[/list]

Add-on authors who were using old-style markup in the campaign difficulty options (the difficulty_descriptions attribute under [campaign]) should be aware that only Pango markup is supported now, combined with menu item markup as in [message] [option] tags.
