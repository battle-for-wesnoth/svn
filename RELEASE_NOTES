This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

***

This release is the second 1.6 release candidate.  We invite all UMC
authors to test this release for compatibility with their add-ons. We
also encourage players to playtest this release heavily.  Now is the
time to report all the bugs that are obvious to you but which we may
not have noticed.

The previous release candidate contained a bug involving ambushed
units which sometimes resulted in corrupted replays or in multiplayer
games going out-of-sync.  As a result, we must require that players
upgrade to 1.6RC2 in order to play on the 1.5 MP server.  Savegames
and replays that worked with previous versions will continue to work
with 1.6RC2, although old corrupt replays will remain corrupt.
