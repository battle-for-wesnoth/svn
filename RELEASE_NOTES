This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

***

There are quite some changes on the GUI front and things should start to
stabilise now. If you see bugs which should be fixed before 1.6 please report
them in the bug tracker.

The message dialog got overhauled with some new images, these are placeholders.
They will be polished before 1.6.
