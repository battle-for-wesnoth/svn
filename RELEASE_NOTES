This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES
=======

[section="Multiplayer modifications"]
Starting with this release, there's a new type of add-on, MP Modification, which allows alterations to the game play independently from eras and scenarios. Additionally, you can have any amount of modifications enabled at a time. You can access installed modifications with the "Modifications" button on the game creation screen. See [wiki]ModificationWML[/wiki] for details.
[/section]

[section="Multiplayer option system"]
Another improvement is the new option system. UMC authors now can have their add-ons display some configuration options on the game creation screen. The settings are translated into WML variables inside the add-on. The options for activated modifications, era or scenario are accessible through the "Options" button on the game creation screen. See [wiki]OptionWML[/wiki] for details.
[/section]

[section="Multiplayer dependency system"]
With a lot of new possibilities for conflicts between add-ons, there's now a dependency system for eras, scenarios and modifications, not to be confused with the already existing dependency management for whole add-ons. See the appopriate sections of [wiki]EraWML[/wiki], [wiki]ScenarioWML[/wiki] and [wiki]ModificationWML[/wiki] for details.

[section="New AI"]
There is a new AI available in multiplayer named "Experimental AI". Boasting an 86% win rate over the current RCA AI, it features several improvements over the current default AI, including village grabbing, castle selection, targeted poisoning, and recruitment.
