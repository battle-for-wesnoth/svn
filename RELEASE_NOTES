This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES

[section="Add-ons manager dialog"]
The old Get Add-ons and Update Add-ons dialogs have been merged for this release into a single Add-ons Manager view with some new features and changes.
[list][*]It's now possible to filter the list further choosing the Options button on the top-right corner. At this time, the additional options offered allow displaying only add-ons of specific types (e.g. campaigns, map-packs, eras) and installation status. In particular, you can choose to display only Upgradable add-ons to get an equivalent view to the previous Update Add-ons dialog.
[*]Add-on installation status is now displayed beneath each list entry in color.
[*]Old and new add-on versions are listed in the Version column when applicable.
[*]Add-ons are no longer sorted by original upload time in descending order by default. Instead, add-ons are sorted by name. An option to sort them by upload time may be implemented in the future depending on the perceived impact of this change.
[*]The dependency installation prompt now resolves all possible dependencies recursively and lists them together.
[*]Add-on filter options are remembered while installing individual add-ons until the user chooses to return to the titlescreen.
[*]Text formatting markup (any of *, `, ~, {, ^, }, |, @, #, <, & at the start of a name) cannot be abused to color add-on names in the Add-ons Manager anymore. Additionally, new add-on server instances will reject add-ons with such names.
[*]Column extents have been tweaked in an attempt to suit 'average' cases (based on the 1.10 add-ons server contents) better.
[*]A Help button has been added along with a dedicated section in the Help.

[section="Under the Burning Suns"]
The campaign Under the Burning Suns has had extensive code changes. While most of them should not be visible, there are several changes that affect difficulty.
[list]
[*]In scenario 2, if healers are preventing dehydration in units, they are now unable to also heal them. This makes the elves unhealable during daytime, except in oases.
[*]The first tunnel collapse in scenario 6b, "In the Domain of the Dwarves", no longer kills both guards.
[*]The AI behavior for the messenger in scenario 8, "Out of the Frying Pan", has been much improved.
[*]The chest at the end of the cave in scenario 8 now grants more gold on easy difficulties than hard and the amount will always take you to positive gold.
[*]There are scattered small changes that make the hardest difficulty slightly harder.
[/list]
Players are encouraged to try these scenarios and comment on the difficulty changes.

[section="Lua updated to 5.2"]
Lua interpreter was updated to 5.2
Some of the changes are not compatible, but still work due to the compatibility mode. The compatibility mode would be disabled after several minor releases, so it's best to rework the code according to [url]http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#8[/url]. Some of the changes in interpreter are not compatible but don't have a compatibility mode.
[/section]

[section="Removed deprecated terrains"]
The old grassland flowers terrain (Ggf) has been removed in favor of ^Efm, introduced during the 1.9 development series. Maps containing the old terrain will no longer load.
[/section]

[section="CMake: compiler flags, installation changes, and Clang"]
[list][*]The code to determine compiler flags has been rewritten and now has better support for compiler-specific enabling of targets. Therefore it is recommended to regenerate your CMake build.
[*]Default manual page installation directory now conforms to FHS.
[*]The Clang compiler now also defaults to strict compilation when building with CMake. Additionally, the default flags have changed to match the ones used for GCC. This has only be tested with Clang 3.1; please file bug reports if it breaks older versions of Clang.
