This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.


Terrain graphic rules for user-made add-ons are now loaded before
the core ones, making custom tiles look the same in-game as they did
in the editor in the previous release (1.5.2).


Editor2 is the new map editor developed by Ilor as the GSoC project. Editor2 is 
a replacement of wesnoth_editor, the old_editor. Unlike the old editor, editor2 
is compiled in the game executable. The old editor remains in its own 
executable, both can safely coexist.

To build the game with the new editor, use scons with editor2=yes or an 
equivalent option in the other build systems (--with-editor2). Remember that 
you need to build the game, not the editor target -- wesnoth_editor is the 
largely unmodified old editor. If building manually, you must define the 
USE_EDITOR symbol and add the editor2 sources to the build. The USE_EDITOR2 
symbol does not affect building of the old editor.

To start the new editor, launch wesnoth.exe and choose "Editor" in the title
menu, or use the -e or --editor command line option, i.e. "wesnoth -e". If this
fails and there is no "Editor" button, it means the game was compiled without
editor2 support.
