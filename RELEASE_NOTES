This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

New (heavy) map-screenshot:
The new map-screenshot feature (Hotkey : "Map Screenshot") may create heavy BMP image for big maps, so if you have limited diskspace, it's better to dezoom before using it.

Smarter pathfinding:
Try to avoid terrains with bad defense or to be blocked by friends (this help multi-turns moves)


Notes for packagers (not sure whether needed in normal notes as well)
* We now depend on boost_regex >= 1.33.0
* We now depend on libsdl-ttf >= 2.0.8
* We now depend on zlib >= 1.0 (with development files)
