This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

This release contains an important security update, fixing a vulnerability
that could allow third-party content (such as campaigns downloaded from the
add-on server) to execute arbitrary code with user account privileges.  Consult
CVE-2009-0367 for details.  All content currently on the official add-on server 
has been inspected to confirm that none of it exploits this vulnerability,
and the add-on server itself has been patched to ensure that exploits can no
longer be uploaded.  Therefore, users of previous versions of Battle for Wesnoth 
who have received user-made content through the official add-on server and 
no other distribution channel need not fear that they have been compromised.
