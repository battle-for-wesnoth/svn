This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

***

This release is the third 1.6 release candidate.  We invite all UMC
authors to test this release for compatibility with their add-ons. We
also encourage players to playtest this release heavily.  Now is the
time to report all the bugs that are obvious to you but which we may
not have noticed.

UtBS: Kaleh's advancement tree has been reworked. This breaks compatibility
with older savegames thus you need to restart the campaign.
