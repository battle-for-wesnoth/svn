This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

project.

This release is the first beta for the upcoming 1.8 stable serie. We are not expecting any incompatible changes, and have been in feature freeze for some time. Moreover a brand new add-on server has been started and should not be reseted before the 1.8 release

This means that all user-made content providers should consider porting and testing now, in order to be ready for 1.8.
