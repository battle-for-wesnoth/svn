This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES
=======

[section="Portraits in dialogs"]
Large portraits, especially high ones, should now work properly. For example TRoW scenario 5 (The Oldwood) now shows Elilmaldur-Rithrandil properly even when the screen resolution is 1920x480. If there are still issues with portraits not being shown, please let us know, either in this thread or by a bug report.

[section="NativeClient"]
Added the NativeClient port code, provided by Evgeniy Stepanov.

[section="Fullscreen in Lion"]
Full screen mode on Lion should now work. Wesnoth currently uses a custom version of SDL to make this work, so people trying to compile on a Macintosh need to copy SDL.Framework from the package into Xcode/lib before compiling.
If you are not using Lion, it is safe to continue using SDL 1.2.13.
