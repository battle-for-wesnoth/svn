This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES

[section="AMLA Requirements"]
The AMLA requirements have changed from 150 XP for all units to 50 times the unit's level (25 for level 0 units).
[/section]

[section="Removal of the 'Khalifate'"]
The Khalifate were a new race/faction added as part of a multiplayer era during the 1.9 development process. The original plan was to have them stabilized before 1.10, but further balancing and string changes are required which will not be ready in time for the planned 1.10. Because of this the development of this faction will continue as an addon which is hopefully merge into trunk shortly after the release of 1.10 (and will be part of the 1.12 series).
[/section]

[section="Start of the feature and string freeze"]
Okay, not a change per se, but important anyway. This release marks the start of the stabilization time for the upcoming 1.10 series. This means that, from now on, we want to concentrate on fixing bugs so that 1.10 will be a really stable release. Because of this we do plan to not add any new features in the next 1.9.x releases and we'll also try to keep the "interface" for UMC creators intact. In other words:
[list]
[*] No new features planned for the next 1.9.x releases, just bug fixes.
[*] No (larger) changes in the available macros and WML commands possible. [b]UMC devs can/should start porting their addons so that they are compatible and available in time for 1.10.[/b]
[*] No (larger) string changes/additions planned. [b]Translators can/should start working on the strings so that the translations are as complete as possible by the time 1.10 is released.[/b]
