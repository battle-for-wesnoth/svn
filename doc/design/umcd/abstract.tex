The campaign server had little love over the years and its code shows its
age. Several new features have been wanted over the years: better dependency
tracking, better translation integration. 

Over the years several initiatives have started, none of these were
finished. Early $2012$ I restarted this project again this document
describes the design and the communication protocol.
