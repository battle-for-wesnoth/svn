.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for
.B Wesnoth
is a turn-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well-chosen cadre of troops, taking 
care to manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have 
their own strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to 
their best advantage while denying your foes the chance to do the 
same. As units gain experience, they acquire new abilities and 
become more powerful. Play in your own language and test your skill 
against a smart computer opponent, or join Wesnoth's large community 
of on-line players. Create your own custom units, scenarios or 
campaigns, and share them with others.

The side-specific multiplayer options are marked with
.IR number .
.I number
has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on
the number of players possible in the chosen scenario.
.TP
.BI --algorithm number = value
selects a non-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for
this side. Available values:
.B idle_ai
and
.BR sample_ai .
.TP 
.BI --controller number = value
selects the controller for this side. Available values:
.B human
and
.BR ai .
.TP 
.BI --era= value
use this option to play in the selected era instead of the

.B "data/multiplayer/eras.cfg"

.TP
.B --exit-at-end
exits once the scenario is over, without displaying victory/defeat dialog which requires the user to click OK.
This is also used for scriptable benchmarking.

.B --multiplayer
to have the desired effect.
.TP
.BI --parm number = name : value
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the

.BR 50 .
