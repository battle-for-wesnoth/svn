.SH NAME
wesnoth \- Battle for Wesnoth, a turn\-based fantasy strategy game
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
\fBwesnoth\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [\fIPATH_TO_DATA\fP]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for \fBWesnoth\fP is a turn\-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well\-chosen cadre of troops, taking care to
manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have their own
strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to their best advantage
while denying your foes the chance to do the same. As units gain experience,
they acquire new abilities and become more powerful. Play in your own
language and test your skill against a smart computer opponent, or join
Wesnoth's large community of on\-line players. Create your own custom units,
scenarios or campaigns, and share them with others.

.SH "Options for \-\-multiplayer"
.
The side\-specific multiplayer options are marked with \fInumber\fP.  \fInumber\fP
has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on the
number of players possible in the chosen scenario.

selects a configuration file to load for the AI controller for this side.
.TP 
\fB\-\-algorithm\fP\fInumber\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a non\-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for this
side. Available values: \fBidle_ai\fP and \fBsample_ai\fP.
.TP  
\fB\-\-controller\fP\fInumber\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects the controller for this side. Available values: \fBhuman\fP and \fBai\fP.
.TP  
\fB\-\-era=\fP\fIvalue\fP

\fBdata/multiplayer/eras.cfg\fP file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-exit\-at\-end\fP

the desired effect.
.TP 
\fB\-\-parm\fP\fInumber\fP\fB=\fP\fIname\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the
options used with \fB\-\-controller\fP and \fB\-\-algorithm\fP.  It should only be
useful for people designing their own AI. (not yet documented completely)
.TP 
\fB\-\-scenario=\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a multiplayer scenario by id. The default scenario id is
\fBmultiplayer_The_Freelands\fP.
.TP
