.SH NAME
wesnoth \- Battle for Wesnoth, a turn\-based fantasy strategy game
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
\fBwesnoth\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [\fIPATH_TO_DATA\fP]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for \fBWesnoth\fP is a turn\-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well\-chosen cadre of troops, taking care to 
manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have their own 
strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to their best advantage 
while denying your foes the chance to do the same. As units gain experience, 
they acquire new abilities and become more powerful. Play in your own 
language and test your skill against a smart computer opponent, or join 
Wesnoth's large community of on\-line players. Create your own custom units, 
scenarios or campaigns, and share them with others.

.SH "Options for \-\-multiplayer"
.
The side\-specific multiplayer options are marked with 
<number>. <number> has to be replaced by a side number. It 
usually is 1 or 2 but depends on the number of players possible in the 
chosen scenario.
.TP 
\fB\-\-algorithm<number>=value\fP
selects a non\-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for this 
side. Available values: "idle_ai" and "sample_ai".
.TP  
\fB\-\-controller<number>=value\fP
selects the controller for this side. Available values: "human" and "ai".
.TP  
\fB\-\-era=value\fP
use this option to play in the selected era instead of the "Default" 
era. The era is chosen by an id. Eras are described in the 
data/multiplayer.cfg file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-nogui\fP
runs the game without the GUI. Must appear before \fB\-\-multiplayer\fP to have 
the desired effect.
.TP 
\fB\-\-parm<number>=name:value\fP
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the 
options used with \fB\-\-controller\fP and \fB\-\-algorithm.\fP It should only be 
useful for people designing their own AI. (not yet documented completely)
.TP 
\fB\-\-scenario=value\fP
selects a multiplayer scenario. The default scenario is 
"multiplayer_Charge".
.TP 
\fB\-\-side<number>=value\fP

an id. Factions are described in the data/multiplayer.cfg file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-turns=value\fP
sets the number of turns for the chosen scenario. The default is "50".
.TP
