     target from multiple directions; the last highlighted adjacent hex now

   * The third annoying end-of-scenario prompt, asking if you want to save
     an image of a new scenario immediately before entering it, is now only
     presented if the game was built with TINY_GUI.  Non-tiny systems do this
     automatically without asking.
   * Added a new experimental way of drawing map edges, this is under evaluation
