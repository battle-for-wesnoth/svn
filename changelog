Version 0.4.8:
- added lohari's new terrain tiles
- adjusted the way AI will summon reinforcements to a combat area by making it still move after summoning reinforcements
- added in new undead unit descriptions by caranha
- fixed some minor problems with undead units pointed out by caranha
- changed Wolf Riders, Goblin Knights, Vampire Bats and Blood Bats to deal 'blade' damage instead of 'piercing' damage, as suggested by B0rsuk
- updated curing/healing. ability 'heals' can heal 8 hitpoints of units, with a maximum of 4 hitpoints per unit. curing does 18/8. White Mage and Druid have 'cure', Shaman and Paladin have 'heal'. Only units with curing can heal poison, however units with heal will stop units losing hitpoints from poison while they are next to them. Shaman now needs more experience to advance.

Version 0.4.7:
- patched the units config files with miyo's patch to clean up the structure
- made it so the game will dump core if it segfaults
- fixed crash reported by zas when a unit attacks
- you can now zoom in and out when the AI is moving
- added improved keyboard control that allows keys to be set in the locale settings. Keyboard shortcuts (in the English locale) are now,

u: undo
r: redo
n: cycle units (including only partially moved units)
l: goto leader
z: zoom in
x: zoom out
c: default zoom
control-f: toggle full screen
control-a: toggle accelerated mode
control-d: view unit resistance (defense) table
control-t: view unit terrain table

(some keyboard shortcuts are still not implemented, and there is currently no way to configure keyboard shortcuts in-game)

- added ability to make different game-paths - e.g. the scenario you play could be determined by how you won last scenario. Dialogs can now be popped up which ask the player to make a selection, and the selection they make determines how the game progresses. (But no part of the game actually uses this feature yet).
- added scenario objectives in scenario 10
- now when the AI attacks an enemy and doesn't kill it, it will move other nearby units toward the place where the combat took place
- if an AI sees only combats that result in loss nearby, it will request reinforcements from nearby.
- made it so that if the macro WESNOTH_PATH is defined, the game will look for its data files at that path. You can thus compile with e.g. -DWESNOTH_PATH=\"/usr/local/games/wesnoth\"
- added benchmarking of times to perform various operations in the game
- made leaders start in a 'keep'. (But need a better image for the keep :)
- added difficulty level settings for scenarios up to scenario 9
