 * made it so the game will dump core if it segfaults

 * added improved keyboard control that allows keys to be set in the locale settings. Keyboard shortcuts (in the English locale) changed
 * added ability to make different game-paths - e.g. the scenario you play could be determined by how you won last scenario.

 * if an AI sees only combats that result in loss nearby, it will request reinforcements from nearby
 * made it so that if the macro WESNOTH_PATH is defined, the game will look for its data files at that path. You can thus compile with e.g.  -DWESNOTH_PATH=\"/usr/local/games/wesnoth\" -- the Makefile does not currently take advantage of this

 * added in test version of a naming algorithm that will automatically name created units that was submitted as a patch by a wesnoth user
