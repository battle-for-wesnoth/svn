<yann> I've launched a build of familiar in the One True OpenEmbedded
	way - then I'll be able to provide a build of wesnoth in that
	way as well
<yann> but building the world does take time :)
<misc> yann: 7 days according to the school book
<yann> misc: the problem is, that was the time needed for the original
	version, it does not take into account all patches applied to the
	repository since that time
<yann> otoh, the tools have evolved at the same time, so that should
	counter-balance things a bit :)
<misc> yann: what patch ? you mean the move of the 2 first process out of
	the low memory, after a forbidden access to the apple bios ?
