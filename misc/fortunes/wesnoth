<yann> I've launched a build of familiar in the One True OpenEmbedded
	way - then I'll be able to provide a build of wesnoth in that
	way as well
<yann> but building the world does take time :)
<misc> yann: 7 days according to the school book
<yann> misc: the problem is, that was the time needed for the original
	version, it does not take into account all patches applied to the
	repository since that time
<yann> otoh, the tools have evolved at the same time, so that should
	counter-balance things a bit :)
<misc> yann: what patch ? you mean the move of the 2 first process out of
	the low memory, after a forbidden access to the apple bios ?

Q: What unites Wesnoth developers?
A: 3 hours sleep per night

<miyo> Skovbaer: Could you please rewrite Wesnoth from scratch for us?
<miyo> Skovbaer: Preferably with Perl :P
<Skovbaer> give me 2 hours :)

Discussing FreeCiv in #wesnoth is fine, as long as you equivalently discuss Wesnoth in #freeciv *grin* -- Sirp

Q: Why don't you get rid of that Miyo guy?
A: We have tried.

Playing Wesnoth is always a lose-lose situation for me. If I lose, then... that's bad. If I win, then I think the AI isn't good enough. -- Sirp

18:45 < Shade> BfW is like crackware, every time you come back there's a new
               version...
