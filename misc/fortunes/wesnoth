<yann> I've launched a build of familiar in the One True OpenEmbedded
	way - then I'll be able to provide a build of wesnoth in that
	way as well
<yann> but building the world does take time :)
<misc> yann: 7 days according to the school book
<yann> misc: the problem is, that was the time needed for the original
	version, it does not take into account all patches applied to the
	repository since that time
<yann> otoh, the tools have evolved at the same time, so that should
	counter-balance things a bit :)
<misc> yann: what patch ? you mean the move of the 2 first process out of
	the low memory, after a forbidden access to the apple bios ?

Q: What unites Wesnoth developers?
A: 3 hours sleep per night

<miyo> Skovbaer: Could you please rewrite Wesnoth from scratch for us?
<miyo> Skovbaer: Preferably with Perl :P
<Skovbaer> give me 2 hours :)

Discussing FreeCiv in #wesnoth is fine, as long as you equivalently discuss Wesnoth in #freeciv *grin* -- Sirp

Q: Why don't you get rid of that Miyo guy?
A: We have tried.

Playing Wesnoth is always a lose-lose situation for me. If I lose, then... that's bad. If I win, then I think the AI isn't good enough. -- Sirp

< Shade> BfW is like crackware, every time you come back there's a new

<isaac>   Who taught Kalenz (to throw fireballs)? 
<C****ic> isaac: he discovered that himself, without expecting it. This first 
           lesson burnt his hair, and that's the whole story behind his funky 
           hair-dye. 
<silene>  :) 
<C****ic> Some mutter it would be a wig, but not too loud for fear of receiving 
           a fireball. 

Some names have been partially obscured to prevent receiving fireballs...

<silene> hmm... "there is a lake around here, with a bridge across it"; 
          Wesnoth, the land where bridges are built across lakes instead of rivers.

On Striped Pants, Ogres, & Haldric:
There was a tale that King Haldric once saved an Ogre Chieftain from death. The ogres noticed that Haldric was wearing rather fashionable striped pants. The ogres subsequently got the idea that wearing pants with stripes made them better and stronger. The reasoning was that if a 'puny' human could save an Ogre Chieftain wearing striped pants, an ogre in striped pants would be virtually unstoppable. The ogres of Wesnoth have worn striped pants to this day.

I ran apt-get upgrade and instead of upgrading Wesnoth, it seems to have erased it off my system.
<Insert Long Post Describing Problem>
I imagine this will be fixed before too long. I certainly hope so. I am already going through withdrawl. /me goes to draw hexes on my kitchen floor, and pretend pieces of lint are orcs. --Glowing Fish
