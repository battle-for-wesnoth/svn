<h1>Features of the WML Editor</h1>
The plugin contains a full edged WML Editor. It recognizes the .cfg files and opens them
 in the WML Editor by default. The Editor supports UTF-8 files not just ASCII ones. The 
 editor is one of the most important features of the plugin.
	<h2>Content assist</h2>
	At any time, when writing WML Code, one could activate the content assist by the CTRL 
	+ SPACE shortcut. A small inline popup will open showing suggestions on what to complete. 
	Currently the plugin can auto complete:
	<ul>
		<li>Scenario ids</li>
		<li>WML Tags</li>
		<li>WML Keys</li>
		<li>WML Macros</li>
		Each item has a little icon to help the user distinguish between suggestions types.
	</ul>
	
	<h2>WML macros</h2>
	One can view the definition of a WML macro, by hovering / going with the caret over the 
	call, and pressing F2. A small popup will open showing the macros' definition. 
	Alternatively, Pressing F3, will open the macro's definition file, so you can modify 
	it or inspect related macros.
