<body>
	<h1>Setup eclipse workspace</h1>
	After you have started the plugin, you can use its features.<br/>
	But before of all, you must setup your environment, so it knows where your wesnoth game is located. By default, after
	you have launched the plugin for the first time, you will be greeted with a small assistant that will help you "setup the
	workspace". The preferences page for the plugin will pop up and you must fill all fields, so the plugin will work as intended.
	After you completed the fields, press OK. Then the plugin will create for convenience (i.e. if you want) wesnoth projects for
	each of mainline campaigns and for each directory in your <b>useraddons/data/add-ons</b> directory. The working directory is the
	directory that contains the data, images, manual, sounds directories of Wesnoth.
	<br/><br/>
	If there were no errors a message window will open saying: <b>Workspace was setup successfully</b>.
