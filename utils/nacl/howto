Building Wesnoth for NativeClient.

1. Get the NaCl SDK from http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/
Setup enviroment:
NACL_SDK_ROOT=<path to sdk>
NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=$NACL_SDK_ROOT/pepper_15/toolchain/linux_x86

2. Get naclports: http://code.google.com/p/naclports/
Build the ports for both x86_64 and i686:
make NACL_GLIBC=1 NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=32
make NACL_GLIBC=1 NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=64
This will install all prerequisites under $NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT.

3. Build Wesnoth.
./utils/nacl/build.sh # build and install under $NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT

# Scan installed files, pack them in bundles.
# You can't realistically download 13000 small files over HTTP.
mkdir -p src/nacl/generated
./utils/nacl/buildpack.py $NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/x86_64-nacl/usr/local/share/wesnoth/
./utils/nacl/genfs

# Rebuild Wesnoth with the generated file metadata.
./utils/nacl/build.sh

# Build 32-bit version. No need to repeat the scanning step.
./utils/nacl/build32.sh
cp wesnoth $NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/x86_64-nacl/usr/local/share/bin/wesnoth32

4. Deploy
Copy stuff from utils/nacl/static to $NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/x86_64-nacl

./install.sh inst

Upload inst/ to any static file hosting.
Open wesnoth.html in Chromium >= 15. At the moment you need to either enable NativeClient in
about:flags, or (preferred) access it through Chrome Store.

Warning: NaCl app will download its data with xmlHttpRequest(). This is not compatible with
CDNs that use HTTP 302 redirects to another domain for load balancing and do not set CORS
headers appropriately.
