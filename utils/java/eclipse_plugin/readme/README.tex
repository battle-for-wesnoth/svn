\section{Everybody}
\subsection{Using the plugin} \hskip\parindent
After you have your plugin installed(user) or running(developer), you can use its features.

But before of all, you must ``Setup the workspace". For this, go in the ``Wesnoth" menu and select ``Setup the workspace". The preferences page for the plugin will pop up, and you must fill them all, so the plugin will work as intended. After you completed the fields, press \textbf{Apply} and then \textbf{OK}. Then the plugin will create a project named ``User addons" in your workspace, which will represent the \textbf{userdata/data/add-ons} directory. 

If there were no errors a message window will open saying: \textbf{Workspace was setup successfully}.\\

\textit{Note:} If you encounter any errors, the plugin logs them in the: \textbf{\textless your temporary directory\textgreater /wesnoth\_plugin}. 
That is usually on linux:\\
\indent \textbf{/tmp/wesnoth\_plugin}\\
or on windows:\\ 
\indent \textbf{C:/Documents and settings/\textless your username\textgreater/Local Settings/Temp/wesnoth\_plugin} \\ 
or\\ 
\indent \textbf{C:/Users/\textless your username\textgreater/Local Settings/Temp/wesnoth\_plugin}

\subsubsection{Wizards} \hskip\parindent
There are some wizards available in the plugin, that will create either projects or config files, based on the specified input. This wizards are available by going to the ``File" menu - New - Other... , and from that list selecting the ``Wesnoth" category.

There are 3 wizards categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Project wizards - ``Empty project" and ``Campaign" wizards create new projects in the workspace. The former will create a basic addon directory structure. The latter will create a campaign and it's directory structure.
\item File wizards - ``Scenario", ``Era" and ``Faction" wizards create a new file in a selected container.
\item Wizard launcher - This is a special wizard. It takes a wml tag as input, and generate subsequent needed tags and key inputs. This is generated on the wml schema, so if the schema is incomplete some tags won't be available. This wizard can create a new file or copy the resulted WML into the current edited file.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Menus} \hskip\parindent
There are currently 2 types of menus: the context menus for different file/container types and the main menu. For a better distinction the menus have the wenoth icon near each item.
