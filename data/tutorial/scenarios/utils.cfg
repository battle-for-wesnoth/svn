#define RECRUIT_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I recruit units again?") (_"To recruit a unit, right click on the castle tile on which you wish to recruit the unit. Then select Recruit, or just hold your cursor over the tile and press 'Ctrl-R'. Next, select the type of unit that you want to recruit, and select 'OK'. In order to recruit faster, you can use 'Ctrl-Shift-R' to re-recruit the last type of unit you recruited.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What's a leader?") (_"A leader is a unit that can recruit. This means that when the leader is on a keep, units can be recruited on the surrounding castle tiles. Leaders are usually powerful units that each side only controls one of. Also, your leader is usually the first unit that your side controls, and starts on a keep. You can select your leader quickly by pressing 'l' (the lowercase letter L). If your leader dies, you lose the game. You can win most scenarios by defeating all enemy leaders.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How should I choose what kind of units to recruit?") (_"You have to carefully review their skills, which are displayed to the left of the unit selection box, and cost, which is displayed after the name of the unit. You will learn more about these statistics throughout the tutorial.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I recruit a unit?") (_"When you recruit a unit, it appears at full health on a castle tile of your choice. It also receives two traits, which will be discussed later. It cannot move or attack until you end your turn.")}
#enddef

#define TURN_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How did I end my turn again?") (_"One way to end your turn is to press 'Alt-Space'. Alternatively, you can right-click and select End Turn, or select the End Turn button in the lower right hand corner.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I end my turn?") (_"When you end your turn, it becomes another side's turn and only that side has the right to move, until that side ends its turn. After all sides end their turns, the next turn begins. This has various effects, including causing all units to regain their full movement potential. The number of the current turn is displayed on the status bar next to the image of a flag. When this number exceeds the maximum number of turns, you lose the game.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are these colored circles for?") (_"Units you control have a green, yellow, or red energy orb above their health bar (the green vertical bar to the left of each unit). The energy orbs tell you which units have full movement, some movement, or no movement. Units with full movement have green orbs. Ones with some movement remaining have yellow orbs. Units with no movement have red. If all your units have red orbs, ending your turn is usually the only thing you can do.")}
#enddef

#define MOVE_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How did I move my unit again?") (_"Select the unit you want to move. The area the unit can move to will light up and areas it cannot move to will be shaded. Select any hex to move the unit to that hex.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How far can my Elvish Fighter move?") (_"Your Elvish Fighter begins with a certain number of move points each turn; this is called its speed. When your Elvish Fighter moves along a path, each hex it passes through costs it move points; this includes the destination. Elves are very fast in woods, using up only 1 movement point. On the other hand, you are human and require 2 movement points to travel through woods.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"So how do I learn what the movement costs are for each unit?") (_"The in-game help displays this information for whichever unit you have selected. Select a unit and type 'd' to display the help for that unit. F1 or selecting 'help' from the menu will open the main help screen, from which you can open the units library. Only units you have encountered or will soon encounter appear in the library, and encountering new units unlocks their help information.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens if I try to move a unit farther than it has movement points?") (_"When you select a unit, all hexes it can't move onto within one turn will be shaded. If the destination is far enough away that more than one turn is needed to reach it, a number will appear showing how many turns it will take. Clicking on a far-away space will set the unit on a course for that space, which means it automatically moves as far as it can towards that space every turn. If you accidentally set a unit on a course, select it twice to remove the course.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What's the zone of control?") (_"A unit's zone of control is the location consisting of all hexes adjacent to the unit. Units cannot move through opponent's zones of control; they can only move into it. When they do this, they lose all their remaining movement. Zones of control are very useful and can be used to block enemies from reaching your weak and wounded units.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I move next to an enemy unit?") (_"d")}
#enddef

#define ATTACK_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How did I attack again?") (_"First you need to move next to a unit. Remember, moving next to a unit with a zone of control erases any remaining movement you have and turns your energy orb to yellow. Next, click on the unit you want to attack to bring up the attack dialog.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Can Merle retaliate from my attack?") (_"Whenever a unit is attacked, it retaliates with one of their own weapons. This means that after each blow from the attacker, the defender retaliates with one blow. This continues until one side runs out of blows, in which case the other unit continues attacking until its blows are depleted as well. However, any unit can only retaliate by using a weapon of the same range as the one used to attack. This means that a ranged attack can only be countered by a ranged attack and a melee attack can only be countered by a melee attack. Most units have more powerful melee attacks than ranged attacks. Units with strong ranged attacks are useful in retaliation against melee oriented units. Some melee units without ranged attacks won't be able to retaliate at all. However, ranged units cannot shoot across multiple hexes; this is one of the distinctive features of Wesnoth.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How can you tell how powerful a unit's attacks are?") (_"Every attack does a certain amount of damage per hit, and can be used a certain number of times per battle. These numbers, called the attack's damage and strike numbers, are displayed in order under the name of the attack on the unit's status table and next to it on the attack options menu. To quickly find the maximum damage an attack can inflict, multiply the damage by the number of strikes. For example, my lightning attack does 14 damage per blow and has 4 blows, so it can deal up to 56 damage in a single combat.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Will my fighter hit every time when it attacks?") (_"Units have the ability to block blows. The chance that a unit has to hit is based on the defender's skill at defending blows, and is listed on the attack options menu after the damage and strike numbers for the bow attack.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I tell who is allied and who is an enemy?") (_"As you know, your units will have a green, yellow, or red energy orb. Allied units you do not control, like me, have a blue energy circle. Units controlled by the enemy do not have an orb at all. Also, the option 'Show Team Colors', in Preferences, causes the color of a unit's controller to be displayed as a disc below the unit. This helps tell you what side each unit is on.")}
#enddef

#define XP_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What's experience?") (_"When a unit fights another unit, it gains experience, denoted 'XP', from the combat. The amount of experience gained is equal to the opponent's level, which is usually a representation of that unit's power. However, much more experience is gained from defeating an enemy unit. The amount of XP gained from killing an enemy is equal to 8 times the enemy's level.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when a unit advances?") (_"When a unit advances, it transforms into a different unit type. This unit type is dependent on what the unit was originally, but occasionally there will be more than one choice of what to advance into. Advanced units are usually more powerful and 1 level higher than they were originally. Also, when a unit advances, it is healed completely and any handicaps that have been cast on it are removed. This is known as 'advance-heal'.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How many times can a unit advance in level?") (_"Most units may advance from level 1 to level 2 to level 3. Several extraordinary units may break the limits of mortal existence and advance beyond level 3, but this is very rare.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when a unit reaches its max level?") (_"After reaching its maximum level (level 2 or 3 for most units), it continues to gain experience. This experience accumulates and can result in additional hitpoints for the unit. Some unit types may even gain additional abilites if enough after-max-level experience is earned.")}
#enddef

#define VILLAGE_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when a unit moves onto a village?") (_"Whenever a unit captures a village, it flags the village for its side. This action takes all the unit's remaining movement. Villages flagged for a side give the side several benefits, including giving the side extra gold every turn, and reducing the total upkeep cost of that side's units by one. The total number of villages you control is also displayed on the status bar after the picture of a house. In addition to the economic benefit of villages, villages can be used in battle. Villages heal the units on them 8 HP per turn.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I heal when there aren't any villages nearby?") (_"There are ways to heal even without villages. If a unit does not move or attack for 1 turn, it heals 2 HP from resting. However, if an enemy attacks it, the unit cannot receive rest-heal. Also, there are some units which heal the units surrounding them. The Elvish Shaman is one such unit; units next to an Elvish Shaman are healed 4 HP per turn. Finally, whenever you win a scenario all your units are healed fully.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How important are villages?") (_"Villages are a key part of winning your battles, Konrad. Many units are able to take advantage of the defensive cover a village provides. The gold income is indispensible for building your army. Finally, keeping your units alive will be your most difficult task. If they are ever to advance in level, you must protect your wounded soldiers and move them to villages or healers. This is war, my boy, and life is fragile.")}
#enddef

#define VICTORY_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I know how to complete a scenario? Will you always tell me?") (_"Sometimes it is not clear how to win a scenario just by listening to the dialog. In this case you need to look at the scenario objectives, which appear after the opening dialog. The objectives can also be accessed by clicking 'Objectives' on the menu. The scenario objectives list victory conditions and defeat conditions, and when any of the conditions are met, the scenario is over. Hopefully, it was a victory condition that was met.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I win a scenario?") (_"When you win a scenario, all your units survive and are revived to full health, and you do not have to pay them for the remaining turns. Also, if your army remains in the area after you win, all villages surrender to you immediately after you win. However, between scenarios 20% of your gold is lost to provide for feeding, clothing, sheltering, and moving your army.")}
#enddef

#define RECALL_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How did I recall a unit again?") (_"By selecting 'recall' from the menu, right-clicking on a castle hex and selecting 'recall', or by hitting alt-r.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I recall a unit?") (_"First, you must pay 20 pieces of gold for each unit you recall, regardless of the type of unit. Other than that, recalled units are basically like recruited units, except that instead of a new unit appearing, a unit from a previous scenario will appear.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Why should I recall my units?") (_"Veteran units have more experience than new units and may have even leveled up. Using experienced units rather than new units will give you a much more powerful army over the long run.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How should I decide which units to recall?") (_"You should usually recall units that have already advanced to the next level. However, you may also want to recall units that have high experience, and are thus likely to advance. You should recall units that will be useful for the scenario you are in; for example in a forest scenario, recall elves.")}
#enddef

#define TRAIT_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What do traits do?") (_"Each unit you recruit is an individual person, Konrad. Units of the same type have slight variations in how strong or how skilled they are. The function of traits is to add variety to your army. A unit's traits are displayed in the Status Table, and the function of a specific trait can be found by putting your cursor over that trait.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"So all units receive traits?") (_"Most but not all. Magical creations like skeletons and ghosts do not have traits. You may also come across average units that have one or zero traits during the course of a scenario. However, units you recruit can be counted on to have two traits.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What kind of traits can my units get?") (_"There are four distinct traits, which have effects ranging from increasing a unit's hit points to decreasing the amount of XP required to advance. However, all traits are designed to improve a unit's power; there are no 'negative' traits. Most units have an equal chance to obtain any two different traits when they are recruited. Also, some races and units may have traits that are unique to them.")}
#enddef

#define GOLD_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How much gold do my units cost?") (_"You need to pay each unit you recruit or recall gold when you recruit it. The cost of recruiting a unit is displayed under the unit's name. The cost of recalling a unit is always 20 gold. A unit also costs gold for each turn it is under your control. This cost, called 'upkeep', is equal to the level of the unit. However, units you do not recruit or recall such as your leader do not cost any gold at all. The total upkeep cost of your units is displayed on the status bar at the top after a picture of gold and then a red arrow.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I get gold?") (_"You begin each scenario with a percentage of gold from the previous scenario. If this is less than 100 gold, you begin with 100 gold instead. The amount of gold you have is displayed on the status bar after the picture of gold. After the start of a scenario, you receive 2 gold every turn. Since you usually need more gold than that, you should flag villages, which give you 1 gold per turn.")}
#enddef

#define TIME_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are the different alignments and times of day?") (_"There are 3 alignments: Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic. There are also 3 times of day: day, twilight, and night. During the day, units of the alignment Lawful, such as humans, do 25% more damage, while Chaotic units such as undead do 25% less. At night this is reversed. During twilight, all units do their normal damage. Neutral units such as elves are unaffected by day and night.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I know what time of day it is?") (_"The times of day progress in sequence: dawn (twilight), morning and afternoon (day), dusk (twilight), first watch and second watch (night), then repeat. This is represented by the sun and moon which each rise in the east and set in the west. However, some scenarios have a different sequence, such as underground where it is perpetual night. You can find out the current time of day by looking at the Status Table.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What should I do when it becomes nighttime?") (_"Wesnoth is a dangerous place, Konrad. Do not underestimate the bonuses you receive during the day and those your enemies receive during the night. It takes a great deal of skill to know when to attack and when to be patient. Your elves, however, are neutral. They fight equally well during day or night, so you should continue your advance.")}
#enddef

#define TERRAIN_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are the different properties that terrains have?") (_"The first property of a terrain is the number of move points it takes each unit to move through the hex. The second property is the defense that the terrain gives units standing on it. This is a percentage which determines the unit's chance to be hit on that terrain. For example, many elves have 70% defense in forest, and are therefore hit on average 30% of the time.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I find out the properties of a specific terrain?") (_"To find out the properties of a terrain with respect to a specific unit, right-click on the unit, select Unit Description, then look at Terrain Modifiers. To find out which terrain is on a particular hex, move your cursor over that hex and look in the upper right hand corner of the screen. This will display, in order, the name of the terrain, then the coordinates of the hex, then the selected unit's defense, then the number of move points it will cost the selected unit to move through that hex.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Why is terrain so important?") (_"Finding good defensive cover before attacking is a key skill. An elf should always attempt to attack from a forest when possible since it has a low chance of being hit when standing in forest. On the other hand, if that elf attacks from shallow water, it would be decimated.")}
#enddef

#define RESISTANCE_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How does resistance affect attack damage?") (_"Each unit has a certain resistance against each attack type. For example, if an Elvish Scout is attacked by an Elvish Archer, the archer does 20% more damage than normal, since Elvish Scouts have -20% resistance to pierce.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are the different damage types?") (_"There are 6 different damage types: blade, pierce, impact, fire, cold, and holy. Heavily armored units have high resistance to the physical types: blade, pierce, and impact, but low resistance to the magical types: fire and cold. All living units have resistance to holy while undead are extremely weak to it.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I learn a unit's resistances?") (_"To find out a specific unit's resistance, right-click on the unit, select Unit Description, then look at Resistances. As a new player, resistances are not so important... you do not have much choice in what weapons or units you have available to you. But, the first time you utterly vanquish an undead unit with a white mage's holy attack you will start to appreciate resistances.")}
#enddef

#define SPECIALTIES_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What do specialties do?") (_"Each specialty does something different; that's the whole point of a specialty. To find a description of a unit's specialty, put your cursor over the name of the specialty.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Which units get specialties?") (_"The specialties a unit gets are determined by the unit type; for example all Lieutenants and Generals have the specialty leadership. Some are abilities that the unit has. Others are weapon abilities such as poison on a dagger blade.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What kinds of specialties can my units get?") (_"There are many different specialties, and learning about them is one of the interesting parts of playing Wesnoth. The two most common specialties are called 'magical' and 'leadership'. Magical attacks have a 70% chance of hitting enemies regardless of what terrain they are on. Units do more damage while next to a unit of higher level with leadership.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Any other interesting specialties I should know about?") (_"Certainly. Elvish Shamans can slow an enemy, which reduces its movement and damage. It is very powerful if you slow an enemy right before attacking it with stronger units. Some enemies will poison you - if that happens, visit a village to cure it. Some enemies are skirmishers, which allows them to ignore zones of control. This ability is deadly. Finally, some mounted units can charge, doubling the damage they deal and receive.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I use specialties?") (_"To use a specialty, you just have to move and/or attack with your units in a way which triggers the specialty. For example, in order to use leadership, you must move a unit with leadership next to another unit, then attack with the other unit.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Are these specialties listed anywhere?") (_"You can read about unit and attack abilities in the in-game help. You can view the help by selecting 'help' from the menu, pressing F1, or by selecting a unit and pressing 'd'.")}
#enddef

#define OBJECT_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How did I get this object again?") (_"Objects are picked up by moving on them. It is nearly impossible for you to know what an object does before picking it up, and what's worse is that you have no way of knowing if an object will be a boon or a curse. On some rare occasions your unit will be able to determine the nature of the object before picking it up and give you the option of using it. However, you should not count on this happening.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What kind of objects am I likely to encounter?") (_"The objects you encounter are put in by the scenario designer, so they vary from campaign to campaign. In 'Heir to the Throne', all objects are beneficial, and most give the unit who picks them up a new weapon. However, there are usually not that many objects in a campaign.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How long do these objects last?") (_"Most objects are permanent changes to the unit that receives them. However, a few objects, such as holy water, last only until the end of the scenario.")}
#enddef

#define WESNOTH_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I play a campaign?") (_"To begin a campaign, run Wesnoth, select 'Campaign', select which campaign to play, then select Easy, Normal, or Hard. New players, even those who are no stranger to war, should try playing on Easy until they get a feel for combat in the world of Wesnoth. However, they never listen. Do not say I didn't warn you, Konrad.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Which campaigns should I play?") (_"The campaigns at the top of the list are intended for beginners. 'Heir to the Throne' is the game's flagship campaign, but it does require some skill. If you exhaust the options that come with the game, the in-game campaign server has more offerings to try.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I play multiplayer?") (_"To play Wesnoth against other people, select 'Multiplayer'. Then select 'Join Official Server'. This will connect you to the official Wesnoth server, where you can join a game by selecting it, then selecting 'Join Game'.")}
