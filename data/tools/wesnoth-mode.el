;; Description:
;;   wesnoth-mode is a major mode for Emacs which assists in the editing
;;   of Wesnoth Markup Language (WML) files.  Currently, this mode
;;   features syntax highlighting support, automatic indentation,
;;   tag-completion and preliminary support for syntax checking.

;; Usage:
;;   Add the following to your .emacs:
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/wesnoth-mode")
;;     (require 'wesnoth-mode)
;;   Optionally adding:
;;     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.cfg\\'" . wesnoth-mode))
;;   to automatically load wesnoth-mode for all files ending in '.cfg'.
;;
;; 1.2.1 changes to the 4-space indent used in mainline and supports #ifndef.
