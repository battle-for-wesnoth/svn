;;; Description:
;; wesnoth-mode is a major mode for Emacs which assists in the editing
;; of Wesnoth Markup Language (WML) files.  Currently, this major-mode
;; features syntax highlighting support, automatic indentation,
;; context-sensitive completion and WML checking.

;;; Commentary:
;; Add the following to your .emacs:
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/wesnoth-mode")
;;   (autoload 'wesnoth-mode "wesnoth-mode" "Major mode for editing WML." t)
;; Optionally adding:
;;   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.cfg\\'" . wesnoth-mode))
;; to automatically load wesnoth-mode for all files ending in '.cfg'.

;;; History:
;; 1.3.2
;; * Major performance improvements to indentation and WML checking.
;; * Fixed a bug where nesting could break when inserting multiple elements
;;   near the last element in a buffer.
;; * Fixed a bug where attributes immediately within #ifn?def were always
;;   reported to be illegal.
;; * Fixed a bug where tags immediately within #ifn?def were always legal.
;; * Fixed a bug where when inserting missing tags, scanning would only be
;;   performed up to point.
;; * Fixed a bug when jumping between preprocessor statements.
;; 1.3.1
;; * Completion history available is now specific to wesnoth-mode.
;; * Added binding to explicitly update macro information from the current
;;   buffer (C-c C-u).
;; * Significantly improved performance of completion and WML checking.
;; * Improved performance for inserting missing tags.
;; * Fixed a bug where #ifdef was never matched when checking WML.
;; * Added completion for preprocessor statements.
;; * Improved macro completion and checking.
;; 1.3.0
;; * Added support for Xemacs.
;; * WML checking is now context sensitive; checks attributes and macros.
;; * WML checks are now always performed on the entire buffer, with results
;;   displayed in a temporary buffer.
;; * Context-sensitive completion for attributes and tags.
;; * Completion for built-in and project-specific macros.
;; * Changed the following bindings:
;;   `wesnoth-insert-tag' - C-c e -> C-c t
;;   `wesnoth-jump-to-matching' - C-c m -> C-c o
;;   `wesnoth-check-structure' -> `wesnoth-check-wml' - C-c c
;; * Added the following bindings:
;;   `wesnoth-complete-attribute' - C-c a
;;   `wesnoth-complete-macro' - C-c m
;;   `wesnoth-complete-tag' - C-c t
;; * Removed the following bindings:
;;   `wesnoth-check-tag-names' - C-c n
;; * Removed `wesnoth-check-tag-names'.  Replaced by `wesnoth-check-wml'.
;; * Completion for an incomplete attribute, tag, or macro at point is
;;   attempted via TAB.
;; 1.2.5
;; * Fixed support for GNU Emacs 21.
;; * Added several new tags to `wesnoth-tags-list'.
;; * Added M-TAB binding for `wesnoth-insert-tag'.
;; * `wesnoth-insert-tag' now takes an optional numeric argument indicating
;;   how many blocks to wrap across instead of a region.
;; * Support for `wesnoth-indent-preprocessor-bol' removed.
;; * Fixed a bug in `wesnoth-insert-tag' and `wesnoth-insert-missing-closing'
;;   causing tags not to be inserted in the correct position.
;; * Fixed highlighting of array indexes as tags.
;; 1.2.4
;; * Improved syntax-highlighting for macro calls.
;; * Underscore is now treated as whitespace.
;; * Fixed incorrect indentation when preprocessor preceeded by whitespace.
;; * Point is now placed at the first non-whitespace character of the line,
;;   instead of the last.
;; * Corrected minor indentation bugs.
;; * Indenting across large regions is now much more efficient.
;; * Fix hooks modifying wesnoth-mode-map causing default bindings not being
;;   applied.
;; 1.2.3
;; * Now compatible with GNU Emacs 21.4.
;; * Added support for several new tags.
;; * Added menu entry for wesnoth-mode.
;; * Significant speed increase to indentation.
;; * Indentation can now be customised using `wesnoth-indent-preprocessor-bol'
;;   and `wesnoth-indent-savefile'; support for `wesnoth-indentation-function'
;;   has been removed.
;; * Trailing whitespace is no longer created when creating a second
;;   consecutive newline.
;; * Spurious newlines are no longer created when inserting a tag elements
;;   around a region.
;; 1.2.2
;; * Added functions: `wesnoth-indent', `wesnoth-element-closing',
;;   `wesnoth-element', `wesnoth-element-opening',
;;   `wesnoth-insert-and-indent', `wesnoth-insert-missing-closing'.
;; * Renamed `wesnoth-indent-line-default', `wesnoth-indent-line-savefile' and
;;   `wesnoth-jump-backward', `wesnoth-jump-forward' to
;;   `wesnoth-indent-withtags-inline', `wesnoth-indent-default-inline' and
;;   `wesnoth-backward-tag', `wesnoth-forward-tag', respectively.
;; * Fixed a bug in indentation where content was needed between elements pairs
;;   for indentation to work.
;; * Fixed `wesnoth-newline-and-indent' ignoring the state of
;;   `wesnoth-auto-indent-flag'.
;; * Fixed `{...}' and `#endif' not font-locking correctly.
;; * Added indentation styles: `wesnoth-indent-default',
;;   `wesnoth-indent-withtags' which implement a a similar indentation
;;   style to the existing styles, however all preprocessor statements are
;;   indented to the first column.
;; * Added support for several new tags.
;; * Modified `wesnoth-newline' to behave more consistently.
;; * `wesnoth-jump-to-matching', `wesnoth-forward-tag', `wesnoth-backward-tag'
;;   now leaves point at the beginning (when moving backward) or end (when
;;   moving forward) of the match.
;; * `wesnoth-jump-to-matching' now attempts to find a target if necessary and
;;   will now work on preprocessor statements.  Will now warn if jump
;;   destination may not be correct (due to errors in WML structure).
;; * Indentation style is now determined by `wesnoth-indentation-function'.
;; * `wesnoth-check-structure' can now be applied over an active region and
;;   now checks preprocessor statements for correct nesting.
;; * `wesnoth-newline' and `wesnoth-newline-and-indent' can now be forced to
;;   perform indentation by providing a prefix argument.
;; * Indentation styles now leave point at the first non-whitespace character
;;   of the line.
;; * `wesnoth-check-tag-names' now reports on success.
;; * `wesnoth-insert-tag' is now able to insert tags around a region.
;; * `outline-minor-mode' now works on macro definitions.
;; 1.2.1
;; * Base indent now defaults to 4.
;; * Added support for #ifndef.
