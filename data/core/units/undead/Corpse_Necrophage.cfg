    unit_description= _ "The necrophage, or 'devourer of the dead', is a monstrous, corpulent thing, which bears only a crude resemblance to a man. They appear to be quite rotten in spite of their ability to move; they are rife with disease and poisons of the blood, and have a stench to match. Likely the most unhinging fact about them, for fact it appears to be, is that they were somehow made from living men - a process about which almost nothing is known, but which can be nothing but nightmarish.

Special Notes:  When this creature gains enough experience in combat, it renews itself as if freshly summoned, healing all damage sustained."+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}
