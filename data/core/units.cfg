When the fire in their body is extinguished so is their life. Because of this they are weak against cold, but they are good against most other attacks. However, due to their soft underbellies, 'sharp, pointy weapons' have always been their weakness, a characteristic most consider very dragonlike. They are heavy and move slowly, but once they reach their enemy they are devastating. Their homeland was an island named Morogor, located between Wesnoth and the Green Isle, but it slowly sank into the sea, and now many of them are nomads, flying over the sea looking for a place to settle undisturbed."

Dwarves are the height of human children, but are stronger than even fully grown men. They are a solitary folk, cautious and slow to anger, but once their anger is roused they are terrible fighters. Wielding many weapons with equal skill, dwarves are effective against many different races. They see in pitch darkness due to their constant work underground, and their heavy armor protects them against almost any physical attack, although magic can harm them effectively. The most skilled smiths of any in the realm, they are often hired by foreign kings to craft magical items, and the weapons and jewelry they make have been the cause of numerous wars."

They do not use many weapons but these, although they are in command of powerful magic, and do use it when needed. Physically, Elves are quite tall, and seem even taller due to their slimness. They are peaceful beings, but will fight against any who enter their homeland unasked. They live mostly in the forests of the Southwest, although some choose to live in the harsh Northlands."

        description= "Goblins are, despite their appearance, members of the exact same race as orcs, and are born as siblings to the orcs. Unlike similar races, who usually bear children singly or in pairs, orcs will have large litters of children all at once; which is a large part of why their populations can explode so quickly. Within any litter, there will only be one or two true orcs, who will grow to the full size and strength of their race. A few more will be half-orcs, notably weaker than their big brothers, and relegated to supporting roles in combat, such as archery. The rest, often a full half of more of any litter, will be goblins. Goblins are puny, and quite frail; similar in size and stature to a human child, even at the apex of their growth. They have a rather tragic fate; a lifetime of near-slavery to their larger kin, and use as sword-fodder in battle. In spite of this, they thrive; in part because they are so very numerous, and also because their brother orcs are well aware how dependent they are on the goblins.

Goblins accomplish the bulk of manual labor needed by the orcs, with the sole exception of jobs which require the brute strength of true orcs, which the orcs revel in doing as proof of their prowess."

Although men originally came from the Old Continent, they have spread all over the world, and split into many different cultures and races. They do not possess much magic, though they can learn it, and can learn many more types of it than most others. They have no extra special abilities or aptitudes except their versatility and drive. Although often at odds with all races, they can occasionally form alliances with the less aggressive races such as elves and dwarves, and the less scrupulous among them do not shrink back from hiring orcish mercenaries, either. They have no natural enemies, although the majority of men, like most people of all races, have an instinctive dislike of the undead. Men are shorter than the elves, but taller still than dwarves or orcs. Their skin color can vary, from almost white to dark brown."

Although orcs are disorganized and prone to infighting, warbands under a strong leader can cut bloody inroads into the boundaries where civilization meets wilderness. Most live in the Northland, away from the settled land of Wesnoth, whose people they are more often than not at war with.
