#define SET_OBJECTIVES SIDE SUMMARY NOTE CONDITION_WML
    # Sets the objectives for a given player
    # Side 0 means every player. Does not affect gameplay,
    # except that it tells the player what the objectives of a scenario are.
    #
    # For example, we could set the objective for all players to: "survive for
    # 3 turns" with this:
    #! {SET_OBJECTIVES 0 "Survive for 3 turns" () ()}

#define VICTORY_CONDITION DESCRIPTION
    # Used in conjunction with SET_OBJECTIVES this sets a victory condition
    # (marked green).
    #
    # For example we could tell player 2 to win by killing all other players
    #! {SET_OBJECTIVES 0 "Kill eachother." (
    #!    {VICTORY_CONDITION "Kill all other players."}

#define DEFEAT_CONDITION DESCRIPTION
    # Used in conjunction with SET_OBJECTIVES this sets a defeat condition
    # (marked red).
    #
    # For example we could tell all players that they lose if they die.
    #! {SET_OBJECTIVES 0 "Survive." (
    #!    {DEFEAT_CONDITION "Death of your leader."}

#define SIDE_PLAYER SIDE TEAM DESCRIPTION GOLD INCOME SIDE_WML
    # Defines a multiplayer side in a scenario that is controllable by the player.

    # For example we can set side 1 to be a player belonging to team "Good Guys"
    # starting with 200g and no income:
    #! {SIDE_PLAYER 1 "Good Guys" "Good Guy #1" 200 -2 ()}

#define SIDE_COMPUTER SIDE TEAM DESCRIPTION GOLD INCOME SIDE_WML AI_WML
    # Defines a multiplayer side in a scenario that is controllad by
    # the computer.
    #
    # For example, we can set side 4 to be a computer belonging to
    # team "Evil Guys" starting with 666g and no 99 income.
    # We also make it more aggressive:
    #! {SIDE_COMPUTER 4 "Evil Guys" "Evil One" 666 99 (
