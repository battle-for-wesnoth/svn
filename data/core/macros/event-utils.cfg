# This file contains shortcuts for common WML events (such as prestart, side
# turn, and such), which can be used to write events faster and in less space.
#
# It is recommended that you only use these if you're confident you could write
# the expanded form as well; these are mostly intended as shortcuts for
# experienced WML authors.

# These don't depend on any other macros.  Please don't change this.
# ! in comments is used in generating HTML documentation, ignore it otherwise.

#define ON_EVENT NAME ACTION_WML
    # Creates a generic event.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut
    [event]
        name={NAME}
        {ACTION_WML}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_PRESTART ACTION_WML
    # Creates an event that triggers when the scenario starts but before the user
    # gets any visible output.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
    #
    # For example, you can make side 2 start the scenario with ownership of the
    # village at 13,15:
    #
    #! {ON_PRESTART (
    #!   [capture_village]
    #!       side=2
    #!       x,y=13,15
    #!   [/capture_village]
    #! )}
    [event]
        name=prestart
        {ACTION_WML}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_START ACTION_WML
    # Creates an event that triggers when the scenario starts, after the map is
    # displayed but before the player can act.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
    #
    # For example you could display some dialogue when the scenario starts:
    #
    #! {ON_START (
    #!   [message]
    #!       speaker=Konrad
    #!       message= _ "Hey, I can see some enemies up ahead!"
    #!   [/message]
    #!
    #!   [message]
    #!       speaker=Delfador
    #!       message= _ "Yes, so it would seem. Charge!"
    #!   [/message]
    #! )}
    [event]
        name=start
        {ACTION_WML}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_SIDETURN ACTION_WML
    # Creates an event that triggers at the start of every players turn
    # For example, you could set each players gold to a fixed amount every turn.
    #! {ON_SIDETURN (
    #!   [modify_side]
    #!       side=3
    #!       gold=0

        first_time_only=no
        {ACTION_WML}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_TURN TURN ACTION_WML
    # Creates an event that triggers at the start of turn TURN
    # For example you can create a Wose belonging to player 1 at turn 3:
    # Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
    #! {ON_TURN 3 (
    #!   [unit]
    #!       side=1
    #!       type=wose
    #!       x,y=12,4
    #!   [/unit]
    #! )}
    [event]
        name=turn {TURN}
        {ACTION_WML}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_VICTORY ACTION_WML
    # Creates an event that triggers when a player wins the game, before
    # the game ends.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
    #
    # For example you could congratulate the player:
    #! {ON_VICTORY (
    #!   [message]
    #!       speaker=narrator
    #!       message="Congratulations!"
    #!   [/message]

        {ACTION_WML}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_DEFEAT ACTION_WML
    # Creates an event that triggers when a player wins the game, before
    # the game ends.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
    #
    # For example you could suggest an easier difficulty
    # the player:
    #! {ON_DEFEAT (
    #!   [message]
    #!   speaker=narrator
    #!   message="Aww.. you lost. Try again with 800g and +40g income?"
    #!   [/message]
    #! )}
    [event]
        name=defeat
        {ACTION_WML}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ALLOW_UNDO
    # Allows the player to undo the effects of a moveto event.
    # Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
    #
    # For example, let's allow undoing reading a note:
    #! {ON_TILE 5 7 () (
    #! 	[message]
    #! 		speaker=narrator
    #! 		message="This is a note."
    #! 	[/message]
    #! 	{ALLOW_UNDO}
    #! )}
    [allow_undo]
    [/allow_undo]
#enddef

#define ON_TILE_ONCE X Y FILTER ACTION_WML
    # Creates an event that triggers the first time a unit steps on a
    # given tile.  The filter can be used to only affect special units, or
    # units of a given player.
    #
    # For example we could make a text-message
    # that is only readable once:
    #! {ON_TILE_ONCE 5 7 () (
    #!   [message]
    #!       speaker=narrator
    #!       message="This is a note."
    #!   [/message]

#define CALL_FUNCTION EVENT_NAME PARAMETER_WML
    # This will fire an event with a set of parameters, for example:
    #! {CALL_FUNCTION my_event a,b,c=1,2,3}
    #
    # That example would fire an event with name "my_event"
    # and inside that event, $param.c will be equal to "3"
    # This will hold true even if the event is fired recursively

#define ON_SIGHTING ID SIGHTING_SIDE SIGHTED_FILTER ACTION_WML
    # This is intended to be used when a regular sighted event can't be relied
    # on (that'd be most of the time). This event triggers when a unit matching
    # SIGHTED_FILTER is first seen by a unit of side SIGHTING_SIDE. This works
    # whether the sighting happens due to moving, recruiting, recalling,
    # attacking (in case DSU was on before the attack) or advancing. If none of
    # those actions manage to "catch" the moment of sighting, then it will occur
    # when the current side ends their turn.
    #
    # The 'unit' and 'second_unit' message speaker shortcuts as well as the
    # auto-stored $unit and $second_unit should work normally.
    #
    # You need to provide a unique ID if you use several of these events in the
    # same scenario. Otherwise it can be left empty.
    #
    # Only works if SIGHTING_SIDE has fog and/or shroud.
    #
    # Example:
    #! {ON_SIGHTING () 1 side=2,3 (
    #!     [message]
    #!         speaker=unit
    #!         message= _ "I can see a side $second_unit.side $second_unit.type|!"
    #!     [/message]
    #!     [message]
    #!         speaker=second_unit
    #!         message= _ "Oh my! I was seen by a side $unit.side $unit.type|!"
    #!     [/message]
    #! )}
