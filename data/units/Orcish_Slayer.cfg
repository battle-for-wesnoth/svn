unit_description= _ "The larger, and often more skilled orcish assassins are called 'Slayers' by their enemies, though this distinction is somewhat unclear. Slayers are fast on their feet, and quite nimble in combat, although they achieve that end by forgoing armor. Their choice weapon, poison, is a vicious tool, and its common use on the battlefield is often the real cause of orcish supremacy.

Special Notes:
Orcish slayers use poison on their throwing knives, and victims of this poison will continually take damage until they can be cured in town or by a healer."
