Slayers are fast on their feet, and quite nimble in combat, although they achieve that end by forgoing armor. Their weapon of choice, poison, is a vicious tool, and its common use on the battlefield is often the real cause of orcish supremacy.

Special Notes: Orcish Slayers use poison on their throwing knives, and victims of this poison will continually take damage until they can be cured in town or by a healer."
