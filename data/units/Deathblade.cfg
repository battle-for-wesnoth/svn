unit_description= _ "In life, the abominations known as 'Deathblades' were masters of combat, soldiers who were both lithe and deadly. Their new masters will often recognize this, and try to take advantage of it by outfitting them to match the skills they once had. Though frail, these monsters are much faster than the rest of their kind, both on foot and with their blades."
