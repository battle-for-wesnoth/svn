	unit_description= _ "The dread inspired by black magic comes chiefly from how little is known about it by the common man. Dark sorcerers have begun to unlock the secrets of life and death, quickly becoming masters of inflicting pain and anguish.

The ultimate prize of the dark arts is complete domination of death and life. Dark Sorcerers may eventually learn how to manipulate life and death by reanimating corpses, skeletons, and spirits. The most corrupt and power-hungry will attempt to completely conquer death through the transformation to lichdom and attainment of a dreadful immortality.

Special Notes: The ranged attacks of a dark sorcerer are magical, and always have a high chance of hitting an opponent."
