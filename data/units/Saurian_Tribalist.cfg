unit_description= _ "Despite their lethargic cold blooded heritage, and their relative frailty, Saurian Tribalists are valued as healers because they can provide aide to their friends regardless of terrain or opposition. In addition to healing they posses knowledge of cold magic. The wisest of the tribalists are confronted with the choice of continuing down the path of the healer as a Soothsayer, or refining their dark magic as Icecasters."
