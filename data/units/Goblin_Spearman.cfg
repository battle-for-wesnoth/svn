unit_description= _ "Goblins tend to try and make up for their general idiocy, frailty, and lack of sophisticated weaponry by attempting to overwhelm their foes by sheer numbers. Though lacking in decent armour or weapons, these meagre spearmen are well-equipped for a war of attrition. The best Goblin Spearman can look forward to becoming Goblin Impalers."
