	unit_description= _ "Only those who have delved into the circles of necromancy know what must be done to turn a person into a ghoul, and it is a secret they are not telling. Whatever unspeakable rites they have performed, the result is a beast that knows nothing of its days as a human being, a creature that shambles about as naked as the day it was born, and gorges itself on the flesh of the dead.

It is because of such things that necromancy is condemned with an almost primal hatred.

Special Notes: A ghoul's claws are covered in poison, and victims of this poison will continually take damage until they can be cured in town or by a unit which cures."
