unit_description= _ "Terrible and awe-inspiring, the most ancient of woses grow to a tremendous size. They are a thing rarely seen outside of legend, wherein they are said to kick aside their enemies like sticks and feathers, and to possess an unearthly strength, crushing the greatest of boulders into powder, as though all the strength of a tree to grow and split through stone over the course of years was brought to bear in a mere moment. These same legends speak of their tireless stewardship of the forests of the world, the desecration of which is often the only thing which could incur the wrath of these otherwise kind and curious beings."
