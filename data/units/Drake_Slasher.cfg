unit_description= _ "Slashers are clashers who have chosen to master the use of a Halberd instead of carrying a sword and the spear. Their great size allows them to use a weapon of matching scale, large enough to skewer a horse as a man would a boar. Their training has also enhanced their stamina and defensive skills, which is a major advantage over their close cousins the Gladiators."
