unit_description= _ "These Drakes lack the ability to use their great internal fire as a weapon. To compensate they have become great craftsmen that can fabricate weapons with emerald edges. The Slashers' weapon of choice is the halbierd, which they use to great effect. In addition, they also wear chainmail to help protect them from the weapons of their foes."
