unit_description= _ "A terrifying, monstrous bastion of strength, a Troll Warrior brings to fore all the tales that have been told of their race's terrifying power. Wielding massive hammers that could knock a house off its foundation, and able to absorb a seemingly endless rash of punishment, Troll Warriors are capable of singlehandedly changing the strategies of an enemy commander they face. A troll warrior is not something brought down by one man, but by a whole group of them, fighting desperately against this hideous strength borne before them. That which causes the most terror about a troll warrior, is not their appearance, or their power, but the fact that one brought even within an inch of its life will shortly return to its full strength if it is not truly sent to death.

Usage:
Troll Warriors fight well on rough, rocky terrain, especially at night. Though vulnerable to archers and spellcasters, especially in open terrain, the raw power of a Troll Warrior makes them a foe that generally must be brought down by several enemies. There are few enemies which can engage them in one-on-one combat without a great danger of being killed on the same turn. Their regeneration allows them to cure poison, and heal wounds without the aid of a nearby village. Their relative weakness during daylight hours is a liability, though a Troll Warrior is still very powerful during the day."
