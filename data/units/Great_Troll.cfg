unit_description= _ "When a troll, gifted with abnormal strength of life, matches that with age and wisdom, it becomes something extraordinary, a beast remembered for generations. Their feats of strength and cunning are the source of most tales about trolls, and to see the stories made flesh does nothing to diminish their grandeur.

Special Notes: Trolls possess the regeneration ability, which heals them as though they were always stationed in a village."
