unit_description= _ "Driven ravenous by an unholy hunger for dead flesh, Necrophages attack their hoped-for food with beast-like ferocity. When they are sated with the flesh of their victims, they simply shrug off all damage sustained as if they had been freshly summoned, to begin their search for flesh again.

Special Notes: A Necrophage's claws are covered in poison, and victims of this poison will continually take damage until they can be cured in town or by a healer."
