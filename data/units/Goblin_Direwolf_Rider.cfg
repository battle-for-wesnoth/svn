	unit_description= _ "'Dire wolves' differ from the garden variety only in size and color. They typically stand taller than a horse at the shoulder, and have an appetite to match. Only a madman would willingly encounter them; the goblins, at great cost to themselves, have managed to tame them, if such can be said.

The claws of a wolf are not generally regarded as being the more dangerous parts, but on a beast this large, they are thicker and longer than iron nails. Their riders smear a poison on the front set, not unlike that used by the orcish assassins, making a swipe from these beasts' paws into a most deadly stroke.

Special Notes: anyone struck by a direwolf's claws will be poisoned, and victims of this poison will continually take damage until they can be cured in town or by a healer."
