These rogues have spent many an unpleasant moment darting through crowds and dodging away from those who wish them ill, a set of skills which is very handy in a fight. Masters of knifework, they can also throw knives with reliable accuracy, and their long hours of prowling around at night leave them more comfortable fighting in the dark.

Special Notes: while a unit with the same allegiance as the rogue distracts an enemy, the rogue may backstab, inflicting double damage, by creeping around behind that enemy."
