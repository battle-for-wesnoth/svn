	unit_description= _ "Trolls have been a mote to trouble the thoughts of humanity and dwarf-kind, who remain baffled at the origins of these creatures, and perhaps more importantly, the driving force behind their unnatural vitality and strength. A fully-grown troll towers above a man, and, even unarmed, would be a great threat in combat. The large clubs typically favored in fighting act as extensions of their arms, used for the same purpose of mauling their prey into submission.

Special Notes: Trolls possess the regeneration ability, which heals them as though they were always stationed in a village."
