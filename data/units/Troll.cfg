unit_description= _ "Trolls, grown to adulthood, are possessed of a fearsome strength. Their stone-like bodies have grown to a size much taller than a man, and their terrifying ability to recover from wounds make them a formidable foe even far from the mountainous ground they prefer to fight in. An adult troll is smarter, faster, stronger, and though one would dare not say it to their face, uglier than any of their children. They wield heavy clubs with brutal proficiency, and form a bulwark of strength in any battle they participate in - the only weakness they have, if such can be said, is their inability to fight at a distance.

Usage:
Trolls fight well on rough, rocky terrain, especially at night. They are vulnerable to archers, especially in open terrain, and should always have a healthy fear of spellcasters in all terrain. They are quite powerful against brittle foes, like skeletons, and quite weak against well armored or naturally resilient enemies, such as their woodland counterpart, the wose. Their regeneration allows them to cure poison and heal wounds without the aid of a nearby village. Their relatively slow speed is a liability, as is their weakness during daylight hours."
