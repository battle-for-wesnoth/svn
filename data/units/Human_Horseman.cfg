	unit_description= _ "Often hailing from the rather untamed regions of Wesnoth, Horsemen are trained from childhood to ride and to follow a strict code of honor. A charge made by a horseman is a powerful but reckless tactic, the worth of which has been proven time and time again on the battlefield. Horsemen excel against most infantry, especially those who have fallen out of line, but must take care against both spearmen and archers, for whom their large size and momentum provide inviting targets." + _ "

Special Notes: the Horseman's only attack is a charge, which doubles both damage dealt and received. This does not affect his defensive retaliation."
