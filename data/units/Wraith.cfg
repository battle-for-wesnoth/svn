unit_description="Wraiths, the most powerful ghosts in the undead ranks, can use their powers to summon a spectral sword that drains the life out of their foes to strengthen themselves. They also have a terrible wail that freezes the heart of the weak. Those slain by the wail come back as Wraiths to serve their killers."
