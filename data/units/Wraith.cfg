unit_description= _ "These tortured forms of what were once warriors are among the most terrifying things a necromancer can create, for a sword will cleave right through them, as through air itself. What strikes with such fear is the thought that these beasts are invincible, a fact which is actually far from the truth.

Because of this, a means was made by which the enchantments that drive these creatures could renew themselves through the very thing which threatened them.

Special Notes: a strike from their blade will drain life from the victim, to renew the wraith. Wraiths have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water."
