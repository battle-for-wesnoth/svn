unit_description= _ "These Drakes lack the ability to use their great internal fire as a weapon. To compensate they have become great craftsmen that can fabricate weapons with emerald edges. The Clashers' weapons of choice are the sword and spear, which they use to great effect. In addition, they also wear more armour than most Drakes. The greatest Clashers can become Drake Gladiators or Slashers."
