Spears are much easier to make and will do well even without a head, though most can afford one. Clad in leather armor, and often armed with a shield and a few javelins, spearmen are the staple of most armies, often thrown into the front lines with only basic training.

Special Notes: the length of their weapon allows a spearman to strike first in melee, even in defense."
