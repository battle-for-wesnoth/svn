	unit_description= _ "Towering remains of what once were legendary warriors, the Draug strike fear in the hearts of all who oppose them. They are driven not by malice, but are forever bound within the dream of unlife, wandering through the greatest battles of their memory, and fighting desperately for release, for a peace bought only by strength of arms. The memory of their enemy, and the purpose of their struggle have long faded into oblivion."
