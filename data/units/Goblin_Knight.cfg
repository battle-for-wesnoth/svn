unit_description= _ "The Goblin 'Knights' have little in common with the men who share that title, and the title is something used only in the parlance of their enemies. The similarity is simply that they are the elite of the wolf riders, likely promoted to their position by their success in some temerarious raid, or something of a similarly base nature.

The wolves they are given are bred for speed and strength, making them quite dangerous in combat."
