unit_description= _ "The best of the soldiers are chosen to become Halberdiers. Their weapon, though a little slower than the sword, can strike with deadly force, and because of its great length, Halberdiers always strike first in combat, even when defending. Halberdiers have great facility at dealing with troops they can keep further than the end of their weapons, but find some difficulty in very close combat."
