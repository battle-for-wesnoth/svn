unit_description= _ "Elder Woses have grown great and tall. Towering over most enemies, they can deliver crushing blows, while resisting the enemy's counterattacks. Watching one unexpectedly come stalking towards you out of a forest is a terrifying sight. They are still very slow and stiff, being nearly immune to arrows but still quite flammable. Drawing energy from nature around them, Elder Woses can quickly heal themselves in the face of tremendous injuries."
