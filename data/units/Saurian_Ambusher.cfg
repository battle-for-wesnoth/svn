unit_description= _ "Saurian Ambushers are highly skilled in the use of the spear. Despite their lethargic cold blooded heritage, and their relative frailty, they are highly valued as scouts as they can navigate through rough terrain and around opponents. Saurian Ambushers possess the strength to take full advantage of this fact. The best Ambushers go on to become Saurian Flankers."
