	unit_description= _ "There is a curious story of a farmer who had a great oak in his lawn, a tree which had stood when his father first broke the soil on that land, and under which his family had many memories. It was thus a shock to him, one morning, when he awoke to find it somehow spirited away, with nothing but a bare patch of earth where it once stood. The poor farmer was never quite the same, afterwards.

Such encounters are all that is known of what are presumably the most ancient of woses.

Special Notes: Woses regenerate by using natural resources around them, without needing to huddle in villages to obtain sustenance and aid."
