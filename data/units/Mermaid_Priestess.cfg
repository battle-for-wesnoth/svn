	unit_description= _ "Mermen share the creed that much of humanity follows, though for cultural reasons, the upholding of this is left to the mermaids, who are more intellectually inclined. It is they who dedicate themselves to the ideal of bringing peace and life to the world, and they who study the arts of battling sickness and injury, maladies which they share in no small part with humanity. Their diligence and piety also grant them certain spiritual powers, allowing them to guard their people against the unworldly.

Special Notes: the light cast by a priestess is magical in nature, and always has a high chance of hitting an opponent. This light does tremendous damage to the undead, and even does some to living creatures. Priestesses are capable of healing units around them, and curing them of poison."
