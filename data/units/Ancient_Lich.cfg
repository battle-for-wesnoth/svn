unit_description="The final form that a mage of the undead can achieve, the Ancient Lich strikes terror into the hearts of all who see him. Not only is his touch that of death, but his spells are powerful enough to freeze even the bravest where they stand.
Should you ever come across one of these, flee fast and far, for they move faster than most undead."
