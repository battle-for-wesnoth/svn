unit_description= _ "Heavy infantry are an unusual choice for outfitting troops. They are very difficult to send afield in war, and are typically useful only in the defense of the city or castle in which they are stationed. Clad head to toe in full plate, and armed with large maces, heavy infantry excel at their sole purpose of melee combat. A few of them in the center of a line will shore up its strength considerably. The downsides to this are obvious, both in the weight of the metal, and the great care that must be taken of it, but in certain situations, these troops are well worth the trade-offs."
