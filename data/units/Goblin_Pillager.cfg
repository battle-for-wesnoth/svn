unit_description= _ "Some Goblins train their wolves to overcome their fear of fire. In raids, these goblins take a supporting role; they will torch the homes and crops of their foes, and also carry nets to wreak havoc against those attempting to rally a defense or reprisal.

Special Notes: being caught in a net slows enemies down and reduces by one the strikes they can deliver in combat."
