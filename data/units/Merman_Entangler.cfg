unit_description= _ "The weighted nets used by mermen in warfare are a difficult weapon to use well; those who master it are valued and revered by their comrades. This weapon helps to cement the utter superiority of a merman in his own element, and makes their race a threat even to enemies who merely approach the water.

Special Notes: being caught in a net slows enemies down and reduces by one the strikes they can deliver in combat."
