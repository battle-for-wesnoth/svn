unit_description= _ "Knights of the highest virtue, Paladins have sworn themselves to monastic orders, pledging their might to the cause of righteousness. Though not as imposing on the battlefield as a Grand Knight, a Paladin is a powerful force in combat, and their piety grants them other gifts. A Paladin is a bane to the unworldly, and has trained in ministering to the wounds of his comrades." + _ "

Special Notes: the Paladin's charging lance attack doubles both damage dealt and received. This does not affect his defensive retaliation. The Paladin's holy attack with his sword deals tremendous damage to the undead, and even some to living creatures. Paladins are capable of some healing, though they can only delay the effects of poison, not cure them entirely."
