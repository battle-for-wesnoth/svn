unit_description="The Young Lich is the shell of a mage who has walked the dark path for too long. To gain control over the undead, a Lich forfeits his own body, becoming an undead himself. Do not think he is any less powerful, for his touch drains the life of any creature, and he wields soul-chilling cold magic."
