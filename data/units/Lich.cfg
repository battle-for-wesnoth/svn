unit_description= _ "A lich is the physical embodiment of black magic's first goal: the quest to achieve immortality. Though a great deal is sacrified in the rebirth, in becoming a lich one cheats death of that which truly gives it terror. For it is the mind that is retained, and the spirit which follows, though the body may wither away.

It is not known, save perhaps by the inner circles of necromancy, whether life is prolonged indefinitely or simply extended. But to even consider such a thing bears tribute to the magnitude of what they have already achieved.

Special Notes: The ranged attacks of a lich are magical, and always have a high chance of hitting an opponent. The touch of a lich drains the victim's life to renew the lich."
