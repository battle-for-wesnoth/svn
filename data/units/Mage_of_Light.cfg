unit_description="The mage of Light is an awesome ally of all lawful combatants, and a fearsome foe to the forces of chaos. The mage's powers of illumination are so great that the hex it is on and all adjacent hexes never experience night.

When a unit is adjacent to a mage of Light, it will fight as if it were day when it is dusk, and as if it were dusk when it is night"
