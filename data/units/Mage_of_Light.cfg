Following a strict code of piety and honor, these men and women work tirelessly to bring life and order to the troubled world in which they live.

Special Notes: the light cast by a mage of light is magical in nature, and always has a high chance of hitting an opponent. This light does tremendous damage to the undead, and even does some to living creatures. Magi of Light are capable of healing units around them, and curing them of poison. They also have the power of Illumination, which increases the lighting level in the area adjacent to the mage."
