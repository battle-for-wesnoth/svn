unit_description= _ "The magic of the wood elves is poorly suited for combat, but effective nonetheless. The forests in which they live can be quickened by a word of command, and will lash out at those who threaten their peace.

Their chief ability lies in healing, and it is for this skill that the elvish druids are revered by their people.

Special Notes: A druid's entangling attack slows enemies down and reduces by one the strikes they can deliver in combat. Druids are capable of healing units around them, and curing them of poison."
