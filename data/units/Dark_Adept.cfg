unit_description= _ "To attract any practitioners, the lure of black magic must be a great prize indeed, for anyone caught practicing the art in the civilized world is subject to a death sentence. And yet there are those who pursue this art, for the prize offered is nothing less than immortality. Hidden away in secret cults, or initiated into the dark orders of the underworld, the training which these fanatics must endure often drives them to exhaustion and enfeeblement.

In such condition, their only weapon is the craft they have so committed themselves to learning.

Special Notes: The attacks of a dark adept are magical, and always have a high chance of hitting an opponent."
