unit_description= _ "At long last, Ha'atel has paid the ultimate sacrifice for the dark arts into which he has delved, and has, himself, entered into undeath. At the apex of his power, he has become a lich, a waking embodiment of dread. He has, beyond any doubt, passed the point of no return, and his power and immortality will have to provide consolation for what he has lost in his quest to achieve them."
