	unit_description= _ "Rarely seen, even by elves, a Wose is an order of creature about which little is known. The elves are the source of most of this knowledge; they know that these beings are not descended from trees, despite the similarity in form, and they know that a wose is more closely tied to the faerie world than the elves themselves, though in a different way. The motives and workings of their kind are unknown, though most posit the obvious idea that woses are wardens of the natural world.

Woses are utterly unwarlike, but possess a great strength. They are, however, neither used to, nor quick at moving around.

Special Notes: Woses regenerate by using natural resources around them, without needing to huddle in villages to obtain sustenance and aid."
