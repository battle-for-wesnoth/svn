unit_description= _ "The word 'whelp,' applied even to fearsome animals like wolves and lions, brings to mind images of frail, helpless, and even 'cute' creatures, so young they can hardly stand on their own feet. Given the nature of Trolls, however, a Troll 'whelp' already possesses the terrifying strength native to their race. Troll whelps stumble about with bodies bigger than grown men, and with strength to match. Their uncanny regeneration, and stone-like skin, make them monstrous opponents, especially on their favored ground in the mountains and hills from whence they came. The only reassurance one has in fighting a troll whelp is their slow speed, and the fact that they have not grown to their full strength... yet.

Usage:
Troll Whelps fight well on rough, rocky terrain, especially at night. They are vulnerable to archers, especially in open terrain, and should always have a healthy fear of spellcasters in all terrain. They are quite powerful against brittle foes, like skeletons, and quite weak against well armored or naturally resilient enemies, such as their woodland counterpart, the wose. Their regeneration allows them to cure poison and heal wounds without the aid of a nearby village. Their relatively slow speed is a liability, as is their weakness during daylight hours."
