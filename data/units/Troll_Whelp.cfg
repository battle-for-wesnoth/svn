unit_description= _ "Describing a troll as a whelp is something of an oxymoron, given that their bodies are already much hardier than that of a grown man. They are clumsy and not yet capable of walking properly, forced instead to shamble about on all fours, but any inhibition this causes them is more than made up for by the raw strength of their race.

Special Notes: Trolls possess the regeneration ability, which heals them as though they were always stationed in a village."
