Wearing full plate, and riding steeds bred more for power than for speed, these warriors form the core of any serious cavalry force. A grand knight at the head of a charge is a terrifying sight for infantry, and is often enough to break right through a defensive line." + _ "

Special Notes: the Grand Knight's charging lance attack doubles both damage dealt and received. This does not affect his defensive retaliation."
