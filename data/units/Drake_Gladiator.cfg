unit_description= _ "These Drakes lack the ability to use their great internal fire as a weapon. To compensate they have become great craftsmen that can fabricate weapons with emerald edges. Drakes Gladiators protect their vulnerable hides with thick brass armour and they arm themselves with as many weapons as possible to fend off whatever opponents may await them."
