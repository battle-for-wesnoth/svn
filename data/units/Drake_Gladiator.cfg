unit_description= _ "With their stumpy vestigial wings and inability to use their great internal fire as a weapon some may think that these Drakes are disadvantaged, they would be mistaken. Drakes Gladiators protect their vulnerable hides with thick brass armour and they arm themselves with as many emerald edged weapons as possible to fend off whatever opponents may await them."
