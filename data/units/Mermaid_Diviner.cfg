unit_description= _ "Mermaid Priestesses meet their calling with a fervor that leaves their human counterparts somewhat taken aback. This may have its roots in a legend they recite, telling of a nameless, shadowy horror which was once the bane of their people. Though little is told about it, it is clear that it was the power of the light which somehow defeated it, and made their people safe.

Special Notes: the light cast by a diviner is magical in nature, and always has a high chance of hitting an opponent. This light does tremendous damage to the undead, and even does some to living creatures. Diviners are capable of healing units around them, and curing them of poison. They also have the power of Illumination, which increases the lighting level in the area adjacent to the mermaid."
