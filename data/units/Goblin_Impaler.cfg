unit_description= _ "Goblins are used by the orcs as fodder for their enemy's front line. Those who have somehow managed to survive invariably equip themselves to continue doing so. A much larger spear helps to compensate for their short reach, and better armor helps to shield their tiny frames.

Special Notes: the length of their weapon allows an impaler to strike first in melee, even in defense."
