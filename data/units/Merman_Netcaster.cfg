unit_description= _ "Fishing, as practiced by mermen, is largely a matter of chasing schools of fish into waiting nets. These are not very damaging in themselves, but they can be used to great effect against troops attempting to ford a river. Smaller, weighted nets can be cast through the air; though these are not designed for peacetime use, they are especially effective in warfare. Mermen use such weapons both to immobilize troops in water, and more importantly, to level the playing field against troops on land, who would otherwise be at a great advantage.

Special Notes: being caught in a net slows enemies down and reduces by one the strikes they can deliver in combat."
