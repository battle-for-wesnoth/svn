unit_description= _ "Orcish Rulers are the chiefs of their tribe. They make the important decisions and lead their people into battle.  They carry a bow out of necessity, but are much more skilled with the sword; all in all, they are powerful fighters.  Their natural leadership skills make them very precious in the battle: if the Ruler is lost, so is the battle."
