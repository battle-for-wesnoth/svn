	unit_description= _ "The greatest of thieves are sometimes tasked to take far more than their victim's belongings. Masters of knife-fighting and uncannily light on their feet, these menacing figures employ any means to silently dispatch their victims, be it poisoned knives thrown from afar, or a dagger planted in the back. Deadly at night, these assassins are somewhat uncomfortable fighting under the open sun.

Special Notes: while a unit with the same allegiance as the assassin distracts an enemy, the assassin may backstab, inflicting double damage, by creeping around behind that enemy. Their throwing knives are also poisoned, which will continually sap away an enemy's strength."
