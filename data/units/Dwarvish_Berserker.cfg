unit_description="Dwarves are an ancient race of powerful fighters. Their Berserkers are a triple threat who can wield a deadly battle axe, throw knives to hit their enemies from a distance, or throw themselves into a mad frenzy, forgoing all defense to double their attack power. In addition, the mighty presence of the Dwarvish Berserker inspires adjacent troops of lower level, giving them a boost in their attacks."
