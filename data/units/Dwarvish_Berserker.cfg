unit_description="The dwarves are an ancient race of powerful fighters. Their berserker can wield a battle axe in a deadly manner, or throw himself into a mad frenzy that forgoes all defense to double his attack power, or even throw knives to hit his enemies from a distance. Besides all that, the mighty presence of the dwarvish berserker inspires the troops of lower level around him, giving them a boost in their attacks."
