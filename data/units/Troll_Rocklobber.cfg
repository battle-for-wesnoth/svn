unit_description= _ "Given the monstrous strength of their race, trolls can turn rather mundane implements into weapons of deadly force. Some trolls piece together crude slings, little different from what a child would use, save for the fact that they hurl boulders instead of pebbles. Though not especially accurate, a rock thrown by one of these monsters can cripple a man if it hits him. Despite being burdened by their heavy ammunition, and lacking in any sort of melee weaponry, a troll rocklobber is still bigger, stronger, and perhaps even uglier than the whelp it once was, and a troll's fist serves as well as a man's hammer in combat. Furthermore, their ability to strike back at an enemy archer makes fighting them a dicey proposition at any range, unless one can attack under heavy cover of terrain.

Usage:
Troll Rocklobbers fight well on rough, rocky terrain, especially at night. Unlike most others of their race, a Troll Rocklobber will make many archers think twice about attacking, and is quite dangerous for an enemy spellcaster to attack. They are quite powerful against brittle foes, like skeletons, and quite weak against well armored or naturally resilient enemies, such as their woodland counterpart, the wose. Their regeneration allows them to cure poison and heal wounds without the aid of a nearby village. Their relatively slow speed is a liability, as is their weakness during daylight hours. The greatest danger to a Troll Rocklobber is a powerful melee unit attacking them in open terrain during the day, when they are weakest."
