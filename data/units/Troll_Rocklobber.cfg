	unit_description= _ "The thought of throwing a boulder in combat has certainly occurred to many trolls, and some have taken to them as a weapon of choice. Because such stones are not always easy to find, Rocklobbers have taken to carrying them in sacks slung over their shoulders. The same leather out of which the sack is formed is easily adapted to a crude sling.

Special Notes: though unwieldy, a stone thrown by one of these monsters is much more deadly than any arrow, if it manages to hit."+{SPECIAL_NOTES_REGENERATES}
