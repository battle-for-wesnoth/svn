# unit_description= _ "Drake Gliders wear as little armor as possible so they can quickly escape their foes when they leave their caves. These Drakes are competent fighters, possessing the internal fire common to many of their kin. Gliders can also effectively use their speed to viciously slam their opponents into submission. The best gliders can look forward to being accepted into the ranks of the high flying Sky Drakes. From their aerial vantage point, these drakes can see past most defensive cover. Their skill at flying allows them the precision to target enemies under such cover."
