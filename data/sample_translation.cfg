	msg2_7="It was our duty, friend. I hope you will grant us refuge here now"
	msg2_8="Of course. The Orcs are brutal. Brutal. Especially what they are doing to the poor mermen."
	msg2_9="Oh, what are they doing to the mermen?"
	msg3_1="So this is the Bay of Pearls. It looks like they have those mermen working hard!"
	msg3_10="But...but...how can this be happening to me?"
	msg3_11="Who was that idiot?"
	msg3_12="Free at last! Now death to the Orcs!"
	msg3_13="Now that we are free, together we can defeat our oppressors!"
	msg3_13a="Death to the orcs! Come, let us all fight them men!"
	msg3_14="Freedom! Now where are those Orcs? Let me at em!"
	msg3_15="Thank you for rescuing us! Now we can help you fight the evil Orcs!"
	msg3_16="At last, we have freed the mermen. Go back to the ocean and leave in peace."
	msg3_17="My lord! You may need the help of some of us who have skill in the sea in future. We would like to offer you help, and come with you."
	msg3_18="Now where is Delfador? I hope he's ok!"
	msg3_19="Ok indeed, friend."
	msg3_2="Indeed it does. It also looks like they have many, many troops. I think that I should go around the bay, and distract some of them. You and the rest of our men rescue the mermen!"
	msg3_20="There you are! I am so glad you are alright! Now we may have a little rest."
	msg3_21="I am afraid there is no time for rest. Konrad, Asheviere has now laid siege to Elensefar, breaking the century-old treaty between Wesnoth and the Elense city-state. If the city falls, there's no telling how many other lands she may swallow up!"
	msg3_22="Oh no! What should we do?"
	msg3_23="You must lead our men to the city, and try to help defend it - or recapture it if it falls before you arrive."
	msg3_24="I must do that? But what about you Delfador? You're coming with me right?"
	msg3_25="I am afraid not, Konrad. I have come across some important documents, and must make haste with them to the Elven Council. It seems that the time to stop Asheviere is shorter than I had thought."
	msg3_26="But Delfador! I can't do it on my own!"
	msg3_27="On your own? My lord! We your loyal soldiers will support you!"
	msg3_28="You will prevail. I have faith in you. Travel north. Elensefar is but three days travel if you make haste."
	msg3_29="Very well. Until we meet again, my dear friend!"
	msg3_3="Very well. Be careful!"
	msg3_30="Farewell, prince."
	msg3_4="But boss, why are we only using bats and nagas?"
	msg3_5="Because we need to control the seas and the merman folk, and nagas and bats are best for doing that!"
	msg3_6="But orcs are the most powerful race in all of..."
	msg3_7="Shut up worm! I'm the boss!"
	msg3_8="Hahaha! Now orcs will rule over land and sea!"
	msg3_9="(Sigh) will someone kill this idiot for me please?"
	msg4_1="But the road to Elensefar was a treacherous one. Konrad and his men were set upon by the fiends of the undead."
	msg4_10="Surprise! Searching for Mages, all I get is elves!"
	msg4_11="The temple seems to be empty."
	msg4_12="It has been an honor to have helped you defeat the undead, my lord. I must now return to my home."
	msg4_2="My lord! In yonder ruins there seems to be some movement!"
	msg4_3="It looks like there are the undead there! Prepare for battle men!"
	msg4_4="To arms!"
	msg4_5="Ahh, a party of Elves approaches. Soon we shall have Elven zombies serving us!"
	msg4_6="There are some ancient temples to the north-west, I wonder what might be inside them!"
	msg4_7="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
	msg4_8="I was hiding in this holy place planning how to defeat the evil undeads, now I with your help, we can destroy them."
	msg4_9="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
	msg5_1="The party arrived at Elensefar at last, but found that the city had already fallen to the evil Orcs."
	msg5_10="Thieves hmmm? Who says we can trust such as you?"
	msg5_11="We would understand if you don't trust us, of course, but it is in both our best interests to rid the city of the Orcs!"
	msg5_12="Very well, you may join us."
	msg5_13="Finally, we have retaken the city! Let us rest here friends."
	msg5_14="Victory! The thieves of Elensefar will be in your service, my lord"
	msg5_15="The party rested for three days, after which an old friend returned"
	msg5_16="Greetings, friends. I see that you have rescued the city! I knew that you could do it."
	msg5_17="Delfador! So good to see you! Where have you been?"
	msg5_18="I have been meeting with the Great Elven Council. This is Kalenz, a lord of the Northern Elves who came to the Council to offer us the support of the North Elves"
	msg5_19="Greetings, friend."
	msg5_2="My lord! It seems the city has already fallen!"
	msg5_20="Delfador, we have captured this city, but surely Asheviere's men will come and attack us! What should we do?"
	msg5_21="The Council has met, and we have decided: we must capture the Sceptre of Fire"
	msg5_22="The Sceptre of Fire? What's that?"
	msg5_23="During the reign of Garard I, your uncle's father, the dwarves of Knalga agreed to make the king a magnificent scepter. It took their finest smiths years to make it. But soon after it was completed, Orcs invaded the tunnels of Knalga. Now Knalga is in chaos, and though some Dwarves still live in parts of it, always at war with the Orcs, the sceptre was lost somewhere in the great caverns."
	msg5_24="Oh, but what has this to do with me?"
	msg5_25="Garard II, your uncle, was deciding upon a successor. He issued an edict that whichever member of the royal family could retrieve the Sceptre of Fire would rule the land."
	msg5_26="Oh, and you want me to get this sceptre?"
	msg5_26a="We will help you get it, my lord."
	msg5_27="Time is short. We think that Asheviere is also searching for the Sceptre, to help seal her place as ruler. If you get the Sceptre first though, the people will support you as the king."
	msg5_28="Me? The king?"
	msg5_29="Yes Konrad. I believe you will be king one day. Now let us make haste!"
	msg5_3="This is terrible news! We must retake the city!"
	msg5_4="There are so many of them. This will not be easy! And look to the south, it seems that the undead are allied with the Orcs!"
	msg5_5="Here come the Elves! With our newly forged alliance with the Orcs, we will crush them with ease!"
	msg5_6="We must take the city, and destroy the evil undead before reinforcements arrive!"
	msg5_7="In the night, three dark figures crept out of the forest"
	msg5_8="Halt! Who goes there? Friend or foe?"
	msg5_9="Greetings, friend. We are from the Elensefar Thieves Guild. We would like to help you against the Orcs!"
	msg6_1="On the road to Knalga, the party was opposed by the forces of Asheviere"
	msg6_10="Halt! You shall not pass!"
	msg6_11="My duty is to kill you!"
	msg6_12="Get out!"
	msg6_13="Protect me!"
	msg6_14="Yes, madam!"
	msg6_15="Don't move!"
	msg6_16="Stay away!"
	msg6_17="Don't move!"
	msg6_18="They bear down on me quickly! I had better use some magical aid."
	msg6_19="They took that village too! I'll make them retreat!"
	msg6_2="The Queen has sent me to stop you, you imposter!"
	msg6_20="If swords won't destroy them, magic will do."
	msg6_21="Fry them!"
	msg6_22="You get paid to kill them, so go!"
	msg6_23="Somebody! Kill these intruders, now!"
	msg6_24="Uggh will kill the slims!"
	msg6_25="Ogres! I need more ogres to defeat them!"
	msg6_26="Surely an ogre will crush them!"
	msg6_27="I surrender! Don't hurt me, imposter."
	msg6_28="I said before I'm not an imposter, but if you yield, I will spare your life."
	msg6_29="Let me go!"
	msg6_3="That's the princess, Li'sar. The Queen adopted her, and rumour has it that she is raising her to be her successor!"
	msg6_30="Think about the story of the old king, ask somebody old about it."
	msg6_31="The old king? I have heard about that, but I know it's not true. My mother told me."
	msg6_32="Your mother has lied to you, child. Now I suggest you reconsider, and either join us, or flee into exile. There will be a great battle soon, and if you are on the wrong side of it, we may not have the opportunity to spare your life a second time."
	msg6_33="I'm not a child, and I don't want to talk about it! Now you said you would spare me, so be on your way. The northern road should be safe for you."
	msg6_34="Good day, princess. Come men, to the northern road!"
	msg6_35="(hehe, little do they know just how many undead have wandered the northern road of late. Surely they are doomed!)"
	msg6_36="No! It can't end like this!"
	msg6_37="Argh! I have been defeated!"
	msg6_38="With Kalenz slain, it is hopeless. We are defeated."
	msg6_4="I'm no imposter, it seems that your mother has lied to you about it."
	msg6_5="It's no use reasoning. There is only one thing she will understand. To arms!"
	msg6_6="This is taking too much time, I best call some reinforcements!"
	msg6_7="Maybe I wasn't using enough forces..."
	msg6_8="Protect the princess!!!"
	msg6_9="Stop!!!"
	msg7_1="My lord! This road does not seem as safe as we had hoped, look around us at the hills, there are undead about!"
	msg7_10="Whew! They seem to be retreating at last!"
	msg7_11="Yes! We have fought them off"
	msg7_12="Now, why did you lie to us and tell us this way was safe, and why did you now save us, young lady?"
	msg7_13="Well, I uhh...well I wanted you to all die after you defeated me, but then I felt guilty about it, and decided I better help you!"
	msg7_14="And where are all your men?"
	msg7_15="Well I left them! I snuck away with a few of my most loyal men. I've decided I don't want to succeed my mother. She would have happily let you all die, but I realized that I just couldn't do that."
	msg7_16="So are you going to join us now?"
	msg7_17="Ohhh, may I, sir?"
	msg7_18="Yes you may, child."
	msg7_19="I can see that our work is done here. We must return to our pilgrimage!"
	msg7_2="Who are these who approach? Let us kill them all!"
	msg7_20="I can't believe it should end like this!"
	msg7_21="Argh! I am finished with!"
	msg7_22="No! This is the end! We have been defeated!"
	msg7_3="To arms men! The undead hordes approach!"
	msg7_4="There are just so many! Whatever shall we do?"
	msg7_5="Just let us hold them off for as long as we can!"
	msg7_6="I have come to aid you, friends!"
	msg7_7="What on earth are you doing here?"
	msg7_8="Never mind that now! Let's fight them off!"
	msg7_9="We also have come to help. When the princess told us of your great need against the undead, we offered our services."
	msg8_1="That is the famous Gryphon Mountain! Maybe if we could capture some gryphon pups or get some of their eggs we could train them as mounts!"
	msg8_2="My lord Konrad, we have to be very carefull, disturbing the monsters in their nest could be very dangerous."
	msg8_3="Nice idea, Konrad! I love flying mounts!"
	msg8_4="Well, everybody, let start climbing that mountain."
	msg8_5="Fools, we could ambush them while they're fighting the monsters."
	msg8_6="We have defeated them! Now what do we do?"
	msg8_7="We must continue north. It is too late to return to the safety of Elensefar or Anduin before winter befalls us. Thus we must cross the great river and continue toward the land of the Dwarves. Come let us go!"
	msg8_8="With these gryphon eggs we should be able to breed gryphons that will serve us. That will let us hire gryphon riders!"
	msg8_9="Onward men!"
	msg9_1="This is the Ford of Abez. When we ford this river, we will be leaving Wesnoth, and entering the lands of the North. The lands the Dwarves once ruled, but which are now filled only with chaos. This is where your father and uncle were betrayed to their deaths, almost nineteen years ago now, Konrad."
	msg9_10="That foolish boy killed himself."
	msg9_11="What do you mean, Delfador?"
	msg9_12="I mustered men to fight against the traitor-king, and of course Asheviere, the one behind it all. We were out numbered, perhaps four-to-one. In the heat of battle, that boy, that foolish boy, came charging at me, slashing wildly. I had little choice but to end him."
	msg9_13="So it is true, that you did kill him?"
	msg9_14="He did die in battle, at my hand. It is sad that Konrad's four brothers did not have the opportunity to experience such an 'honorable' death."
	msg9_15="Oh, what happened to them?"
	msg9_16="With all respect my lords, we must make haste. We have to ford the river as a matter of urgency. Look! It seems that the guard towers on the river banks are guarded!"
	msg9_17="Look! Some of the southerners, the men of Wesnoth are trying to cross into our lands! We will have to stop them men!"
	msg9_18="Isn't there somewhere else we can cross? Maybe upstream?"
	msg9_19="Winter bears down on us fast. We have only a few days to make the crossing, and the nearest bridge is far upstream. To be trapped south of the river when winter arrives would be suicidal, Asheviere would have us like rats! Look to the west! Asheviere has a border fort here, and it seems to be full of soldiers! We must cross here, and quickly!"
	msg9_19a="Who are those who try to cross the river? After them men! Don't let them cross!"
	msg9_2="Really? So what happened, Delfador?"
	msg9_20="Come, let us go!"
	msg9_3="The forces of the king were encamped here. The forces of the north were camped on the north side of the river. For three days and three nights the armies faced each other, neither one willing to ford the river. On the fourth day, the northern armies crossed the river, and attacked us."
	msg9_4="Oh, what happened then? Who won?"
	msg9_5="We were winning the battle. We were repelling them."
	msg9_6="Until the king's son, in the heat of battle, until he turned on the king!"
	msg9_7="Oh, and then you....you killed the prince, right Delfador?"
	msg9_8="When I saw the king betrayed and his banner fall, I fled the battle. Be it wisdom or be it cowardice, I fled the battle, seeing us have no hope that day."
	msg9_9="But my mother...the Queen, she always told me that you killed my brother, Sir"
	msg9_a1="Ruaarrrrrrrr!"
	msg9_a2="What is that?"
	msg9_a3="Creatures of the deep are upon us! This may be very dangerous. Quick, we must get to the other side as fast as we can!"
	msg9_a4="We have made it across the river safely! Where to now?"
	msg9_a5="We must continue north. We must seek help with the northern Dwarves if we are to stand a hope of penetrating into Knalga."
	msg=10_10="If this is true, Konrad, perhaps we should take another route and go around the mountain, rather then to try and defeat these new foes."

	tut10="Yes, exactly! It's also important to try to stop me from controlling villages, and to capture villages I do control off me, so that I get as little gold as possible."
	tut11="Okay men, let's capture some villages!"
	tut12="So how should I choose what kind of soldiers to hire, Delfador?"
	tut13="You have to carefully review their skills. Early on, you want fast units to sieze as many villages as possible. After that, fighters should probably make up the bulk of your army. Remember that all Elvish units fight very well in forest. Horsemen are excellent on open ground. Mages are good for support, and can be used much like archers. If you can get your mages more experienced, they can be especially powerful."
	tut14="When you choose to attack an enemy unit, you can choose which weapon to use, and review the odds of hitting and the damage each blow will do"
	tut15="A nice try, Konrad, but it seems your skills have much to be improved still."
	tut16="You have bested me, Konrad. Congratulations on your skill. You have passed the training test."
	tut2="Welcome to the training grounds, Konrad. Let us see you prove your skill by defeating me in a mock battle."
	tut3="Uhh...ok, how do I start?"
	tut4="You have two hundred pieces of gold to hire some soldiers with. The first thing you should do is recruit some soldiers (Right-click and select 'Recruit'). You can only recruit soldiers when you're in your castle, so it's important you don't move off it too early."
	tut5="Ok I think I'm ready. Let's go!"
	tut6="Of course, I am hiring soldiers too, to fight against yours."
	tut7="Okay. So how do I get more gold to hire more soldiers?"
	tut8="If you move one of your soldiers onto a village, it will become controlled by you. Every village you control will give you two pieces of gold every turn. Every soldier you have will cost you one piece of gold per turn."
