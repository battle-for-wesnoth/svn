	story="To the South-West lay the Midlands. These were prosperous kingdoms, nestled between hill and forest. They served as the breadbasket of a people, and as a valuable source of both lumber and gemstones. These Kingdoms fed the city of Southbay, the largest city on the Isle. Albeit, with this coming of the Orcs the midlands are probably a barren waste by now."

	story="The river road follows to Isle's greatest river to the South-East. This road leads to the Isle's second largest city, Clearwater Port. It would likely have been the Isle's largest city save for the events of the Estfolk War. The Lich-Lords befouled much of the land around the river during the course of a great battle. Now the swamp is home to an Estfolk imitating cult."
