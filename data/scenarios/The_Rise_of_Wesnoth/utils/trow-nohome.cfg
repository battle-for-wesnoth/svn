	story= _ "To the South-West lay the Midlands. These were prosperous kingdoms, nestled between hill and forest. They served as the breadbasket of a people, and as a valuable source of both lumber and gemstones. These Kingdoms fed the city of Southbay, the largest city on the Isle.

Now the swamp is home to a Wesfolk imitating cult."
