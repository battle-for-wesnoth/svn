@Loyal: The unit never has a upkeep cost above 1.
@Strong: The unit does extra damage in close combat, and has a few more hitpoints.
@Quick: The unit has one extra movement point, but a few less hitpoints.
@Resilient: The unit has more hitpoints.
@Intelligent: The unit requires less experience to advance a level.")}

The cost of recalling a unit is always 20 gold. A unit also costs gold for each turn it is under your control. This cost, called 'upkeep', is equal to the level of the unit. However, units you do not recruit or recall such as your leader do not cost any gold at all. The total upkeep cost of your units is displayed on the status bar at the top after a picture of gold and then a red arrow.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION ("How do I get gold?") ("You begin each level with a percentage of gold from the previous level. If this is less than 100 gold, you begin with 100 gold instead. The amount of gold you have is displayed on the status bar after the picture of gold. After the start of a scenario, you receive 2 gold every turn. Since you usually need more gold than that, you should flag villages, which give you 1 gold per turn.")}

During day, units of the alignment Lawful, such as humans, do 25% more damage, while Chaotic units such as undead do 25% less. At night it is reversed. During twilight, all units do their normal damage. Neutral units such as elves are unaffected by day and night.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION ("How do I know what time of day it is?") ("The times of day usually progress in a sequence: twilight, day, day, twilight, night, night, then repeat. However some scenarios have a different sequence, such as underground where it is perpetually night. You can find out the current time of day by looking at the Status Table.")}

{QUESTION_OPTION ("What are the different properties that terrains have?") ("Two terrains have properties which have already been described; namely villages and castle. However the properties of most terrains are more subtle, and have to do with the advantages and disadvantages different units have when they move onto them. The first property of a terrain is the number of move points it takes each unit to move through the hex. The second property is the defense that the terrain gives units standing on it.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION ("How do I find out the properties of a specific terrain?") ("To find out the properties of a terrain with respect to a specific unit, right-click on the unit, select Unit Description, then select Terrain Modifiers. To find out which terrain is on a particular hex, move your cursor over that hex and look in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. This will display, in order, the name of the terrain, then the coordinates of the hex, then the selected unit's defense, then the number of move points it will cost the selected unit to move through that hex.")}

However one of the principles of Wesnoth is to avoid being a *get-the-powerups* game, so there are usually not that many objects in a campaign.")}
