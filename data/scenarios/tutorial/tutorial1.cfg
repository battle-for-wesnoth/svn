When your Elvish Fighter moves along a path, each hex he goes through costs him move points; this includes his destination. When you select your Elvish Fighter, all hexes he can't move onto within one turn will be shaded. If the destination is far enough away that he needs more than one turn to reach it, a number will appear showing how many turns it will take him. Clicking on a far-away space will set the unit on a course for that space, which means it automatically moves as far as it can towards that space every turn. If you accidentally set a unit on a course, select it twice to remove the course.")}

Zones of control can be used to block enemies from reaching your weak and wounded units.")}

Units with full movement have green: ones with some movement yellow, ones with no movement red. Units controlled by the enemy do not have an energy circle. Allied units you do not control, like me, have a blue energy circle.

{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Can Merle retaliate from my attack?") (_"Whenever a unit is attacked, it retaliates with one of their own weapons. This means that after each blow from the attacker, the defender retaliates with one blow. This continues until one side runs out of blows, in which case the other unit continues attacking until its blows are depleted as well. However, any unit can only retaliate by using a weapon of the same range as the one used to attack. This means that a ranged attack can only be countered by a ranged attack and a melee attack can only be countered by a melee attack. Most units have more powerful melee attacks than ranged, so units with ranged attacks are useful in that retaliation against them is less powerful; often there is no retaliation. However ranged units cannot shoot across multiple hexes; this is one of the distinctive features of Wesnoth.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How can you tell how powerful a unit's attacks are?") (_"Every attack does a certain amount of damage per hit, and can be used a certain number of times per battle. These numbers, called the attack's damage and strike numbers, are displayed in order under the name of the attack on the unit's status table and next to it on the attack options menu. To quickly find the maximum damage an attack can inflict, multiply the damage by the number of strikes. For example, my lightning attack does 14 damage per blow and has 4 blows, so it can deal up to 56 damage in a single combat.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Will my fighter hit every time when he attacks?") (_"Units have the ability to block blows. The chance that a unit has to hit is based on the defender's skill at defending blows, and is listed on the attack options menu after the damage and strike numbers for the bow attack.")}

The amount of XP gained from killing an enemy is equal to 8 times the enemy's level.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when a unit advances?") (_"When a unit advances, it transforms into a different unit type. This unit type is dependent on what the unit was originally, but occasionally there will be more than one choice of what to advance into. Advanced units are usually more powerful and 1 level higher than they were originally. Also, when a unit advances, it is healed completely and any handicaps that have been cast on it are removed.

This action takes all of the unit's remaining movement. Villages flagged for a side give the side several benefits, including giving the side a extra gold coin every turn, and reducing the total upkeep cost of that side's units by one. The total number of villages you control is also displayed on the status bar after the picture of a house. In addition to the economic benefit of villages, villages can be used in battle. Villages heal the units on them 8 HP per turn.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I heal when there aren't any villages nearby?") (_"There are ways to heal even without villages. If a unit does not move or attack for 1 turn, he heals 2 HP from resting. However if an enemy attacks him he cannot receive rest-heal. Also, there are some units which heal the units surrounding them. The Elvish Shaman is one such unit; units next to an Elvish Shaman are healed 4 HP per turn. Finally, whenever you win a level all your units are healed fully.")}
