#define RECRUIT_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I recruit units?") (_"To recruit a unit, right click on the castle tile on which you wish to recruit the unit. Then select Recruit, or just hold your cursor over the tile and press 'Ctrl-R'. Next, select the type of unit that you want to recruit, and select 'OK'. In order to recruit faster, you can use 'Ctrl-Shift-R' to re-recruit the last type of unit you recruited.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What's a leader?") (_"A leader is a unit that can recruit. This means that when the leader is on a keep, he can recruit units on the surrounding castle tiles. Leaders are usually powerful units that each side only controls one of. Also, your leader is usually the first unit that your side controls, and starts on a keep. You can select your leader quickly by pressing 'l'. If your leader dies, you lose the game. You can win most scenarios by defeating all enemy leaders.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How should I choose what kind of units to recruit?") (_"You have to carefully review their skills, which are displayed to the left of the unit selection box, and cost, which is displayed after the name of the unit. You will learn more about these statistics throughout the tutorial.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I recruit a unit?") (_"When you recruit a unit, it appears at full health on a castle tile of your choice. It also receives two traits, which will be discussed later. It cannot move or attack until you end your turn.")}
#enddef

#define TURN_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I end my turn?") (_"One way to end your turn is to press 'Alt-E'. Alternatively, you can right-click and select End Turn, or select the End Turn button in the lower-right hand corner.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I end my turn?") (_"When you end your turn, it becomes another side's turn and only that side has the right to move, until that side ends its turn. After all sides end their turns, the next turn begins. This has various effects, including causing all units to regain their full movement potential. The number of the current turn is displayed on the status bar next to the image of a flag. When this number exceeds the maximum number of turns, you lose the game.")}
#enddef

#define MOVE_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How far can my Elvish Fighter move?") (_"Your Elvish Fighter begins with a certain number of move points each turn; this is called his speed. When your Elvish Fighter moves along a path, each hex he goes through costs him move points; this includes his destination. When you select your Elvish Fighter, all hexes he can't move onto within one turn will be shaded. If the destination is far enough away that he needs more than one turn to reach it, a number will appear showing how many turns it will take him. Clicking on a far-away space will set the unit on a course for that space, which means it automatically moves as far as it can towards that space every turn. If you accidentally set a unit on a course, select it twice to remove the course.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What's the zone of control?") (_"A unit's zone of control is the location consisting of all hexes the unit is adjacent to. Units cannot move through opponent's zones of control; they can only move into it. When they do this, they lose all of their remaining movement. Zones of control can be used to block enemies from reaching your weak and wounded units.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I tell who is allied and who is an enemy?") (_"Units you control have a green, yellow, or red energy circle above their health bar, the green vertical bar next to them. Units with full movement have green: ones with some movement yellow, ones with no movement red. Units controlled by the enemy do not have an energy circle. Allied units you do not control, like me, have a blue energy circle. Also, the option 'Show Team Colors', in Preferences, causes the color of a unit's controller is displayed as a disc below the unit.")}
#enddef

#define ATTACK_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Can Merle retaliate from my attack?") (_"Whenever a unit is attacked, it retaliates with one of their own weapons. This means that after each blow from the attacker, the defender retaliates with one blow. This continues until one side runs out of blows, in which case the other unit continues attacking until its blows are depleted as well. However, any unit can only retaliate by using a weapon of the same range as the one used to attack. This means that a ranged attack can only be countered by a ranged attack and a melee attack can only be countered by a melee attack. Most units have more powerful melee attacks than ranged attacks. Units with strong ranged attacks are useful in retaliation against melee oriented units. Some melee units without ranged attacks won't be able to retaliate at all. However ranged units cannot shoot across multiple hexes; this is one of the distinctive features of Wesnoth.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How can you tell how powerful a unit's attacks are?") (_"Every attack does a certain amount of damage per hit, and can be used a certain number of times per battle. These numbers, called the attack's damage and strike numbers, are displayed in order under the name of the attack on the unit's status table and next to it on the attack options menu. To quickly find the maximum damage an attack can inflict, multiply the damage by the number of strikes. For example, my lightning attack does 14 damage per blow and has 4 blows, so it can deal up to 56 damage in a single combat.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Will my fighter hit every time when he attacks?") (_"Units have the ability to block blows. The chance that a unit has to hit is based on the defender's skill at defending blows, and is listed on the attack options menu after the damage and strike numbers for the bow attack.")}
#enddef

#define XP_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What's experience?") (_"When a unit fights another unit, it gains experience, denoted 'XP', from the combat. The amount of experience gained is equal to the opponent's level, which is usually a representation of that unit's power. However, much more experience is gained from defeating an enemy unit. The amount of XP gained from killing an enemy is equal to 8 times the enemy's level.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when a unit advances?") (_"When a unit advances, it transforms into a different unit type. This unit type is dependent on what the unit was originally, but occasionally there will be more than one choice of what to advance into. Advanced units are usually more powerful and 1 level higher than they were originally. Also, when a unit advances, it is healed completely and any handicaps that have been cast on it are removed. This is known as 'advance-heal'.")}
#enddef

#define VILLAGE_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when a unit moves onto a village?") (_"Whenever a unit moves onto a village, he flags the village for his side. This action takes all of the unit's remaining movement. Villages flagged for a side give the side several benefits, including giving the side an extra gold coin every turn, and reducing the total upkeep cost of that side's units by one. The total number of villages you control is also displayed on the status bar after the picture of a house. In addition to the economic benefit of villages, villages can be used in battle. Villages heal the units on them 8 HP per turn.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I heal when there aren't any villages nearby?") (_"There are ways to heal even without villages. If a unit does not move or attack for 1 turn, he heals 2 HP from resting. However if an enemy attacks him he cannot receive rest-heal. Also, there are some units which heal the units surrounding them. The Elvish Shaman is one such unit; units next to an Elvish Shaman are healed 4 HP per turn. Finally, whenever you beat a scenario all of your units are fully healed.")}
#enddef

#define VICTORY_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I know how to complete a scenario? Will you always tell me?") (_"Sometimes it is not clear how to win a scenario just by listening to the dialog. In this case you need to look at the scenario objectives, which appear after the opening dialog. It can also be accessed by clicking 'Objectives' on the menu. The scenario objectives are a list of victory conditions and defeat conditions, and when any of the conditions are met, the scenario is over. Hopefully, it was a victory condition that was met.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I win a scenario?") (_"When you win a scenario, all of your units survive and are revived to full health, and you do not have to pay them for the remaining turns. Also, if your army remains in the area after you win, all villages surrender to you immediately after you win. However between scenarios, 20% of your gold is lost.")}
#enddef

#define RECALL_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What happens when I recall a unit?") (_"First, you must pay 20 pieces of gold for each unit you recall, regardless of the type of unit. Other than that, recalled units are basically like recruited units, except that instead of a new unit appearing, a unit from a previous scenario will appear.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How should I decide which units to recall?") (_"You should usually recall units that have already advanced to the next level. However, you may also want to recall units that have high experience, and are thus likely to advance. You should recall units that will be useful for the scenario you are in; for example in a forest scenario, recall elves.")}
#enddef

#define TRAIT_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What do traits do?") (_"The function of traits is add variety by making units of the same type different from each other. This is done by randomly assigning each unit traits when they are recruited. The traits that a unit has are displayed on the Status Table, and the function of a specific trait can be found by putting your cursor over that trait.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What kind of traits can my units get?") (_"There are four distinct traits, which have effects ranging from increasing a unit's hit points to decreasing the amount of XP required to advance. However all traits are designed to improve unit's power; there are no 'negative' traits. Most units have an equal chance to get any two different traits when they are recruited. Also, some races and units may have traits that are unique to them.")}
#enddef

#define GOLD_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How much gold do my units cost?") (_"You need to pay each unit you recruit or recall gold when you recruit it. The cost of recruiting a unit is displayed under the unit's name. The cost of recalling a unit is always 20 gold. A unit also costs gold for each turn it is under your control. This cost, called 'upkeep', is equal to the level of the unit. However, units you do not recruit or recall such as your leader do not cost any gold at all. The total upkeep cost of your units is displayed on the status bar at the top after a picture of gold and then a red arrow.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I get gold?") (_"You begin each scenario with a percentage of gold from the previous scenario. If this is less than 100 gold, you begin with 100 gold instead. The amount of gold you have is displayed on the status bar after the picture of gold. After the start of a scenario, you receive 2 gold every turn. Since you usually need more gold than that, you should flag villages, which give you 1 gold per turn.")}
#enddef

#define TIME_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are the different alignments and times of day?") (_"There are 3 alignments: Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic. There are also 3 times of day: day, twilight, and night. During day, units of the alignment Lawful, such as humans, do 25% more damage, while Chaotic units such as undead do 25% less. At night it is reversed. During twilight, all units do their normal damage. Neutral units such as elves are unaffected by day and night.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I know what time of day it is?") (_"The times of day usually progress in a sequence: dawn- identical to twilight, morning- day, evening- day, dusk- twilight, first-watch- night, second-watch- night, then repeat. This is represented by the sun and moon which each rise in the east and set in the west. However some scenarios have a different sequence, such as underground where it is perpetually night. You can find out the current time of day by looking at the Status Table.")}
#enddef

#define TERRAIN_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are the different properties that terrains have?") (_"Two terrains have properties which have already been described; namely villages and castle. However the properties of most terrains are more subtle, and have to do with the advantages and disadvantages different units have when they move onto them. The first property of a terrain is the number of move points it takes each unit to move through the hex. The second property is the defense that the terrain gives units standing on it. This is a percentage which determines the unit's chance to be hit on that terrain. For example; many elves have 70% defense in woods, and are therefore hit 30% of the time.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I find out the properties of a specific terrain?") (_"To find out the properties of a terrain with respect to a specific unit, right-click on the unit, select Unit Description, then look at Terrain Modifiers. To find out which terrain is on a particular hex, move your cursor over that hex and look in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. This will display, in order, the name of the terrain, then the coordinates of the hex, then the selected unit's defense, then the number of move points it will cost the selected unit to move through that hex.")}
#enddef

#define RESISTANCE_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How does resistance affect attack damage?") (_"Each unit has a certain resistance against each attack type. This resistance is a percentage which is subtracted from the damage of opponent's weapons of that type. For example, if an Elvish Scout is attacked by an Elvish Archer, the archer does 20% more damage than normal, since Elvish Scouts have -20% resistance to pierce. This bonus/penalty is calculated additively with other bonuses/penalties like time of day, so two -50% penalties would add up to -100%.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are the different damage types?") (_"There are 6 different damage types: blade, pierce, impact, fire, cold, and holy. Heavily armored units have high resistance to the physical types: blade, pierce, and impact, but low resistance to the magical types: fire and cold. All living units have resistance to holy while undead are extremely weak to it. To find out a specific unit's resistance, right-click on the unit, select Unit Description, then look at Resistances.")}
#enddef

#define SPECIALTIES_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What do specialties do?") (_"Each specialty does something different; that's the whole point of a specialty. To find a description of a unit's specialty, put your cursor over the name of the specialty.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Which units get specialties?") (_"The specialties a unit gets are determined by the unit type; for example all generals have the specialty leadership. There are two kinds of specialties: abilities, and attack specials. Abilities apply to units while attack specials only apply to one of the unit's attacks.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What kinds of specialties can my units get?") (_"There are many different specialties, and learning about them is one of the interesting parts of playing Wesnoth. The two most common specialties are called 'magical' and 'leadership'. Magical attacks have a 70% chance of hitting enemies regardless of what terrain they are on. Units do more damage while next to a unit of higher level with leadership.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I use specialties?") (_"To use a specialty, you just have to move and/or attack with your units in a way which triggers the specialty. For example, in order to use leadership, you must move a unit with leadership next to another unit, then attack with the other unit.")}
#enddef

#define OBJECT_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What kind of objects am I likely to encounter?") (_"The objects you encounter are put in by the scenario designer, so they vary from campaign to campaign. In Heir to the Throne, most objects give the unit who picks them up a new weapon. However there are usually not that many objects in a campaign.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How long do these objects last?") (_"Most objects are permanent changes to the unit that receives them. However a few objects, such as holy water, last only until the end of the scenario.")}
#enddef

#define WESNOTH_QUESTIONS
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I play a campaign?") (_"To begin a campaign, run Wesnoth, select 'Campaign', select which campaign to play, then select Easy, Normal, or Hard. Heir to the Throne is the suggested for newcomers to Wesnoth.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I play multiplayer?") (_"To play Wesnoth against other people, select 'Multiplayer'. Then select 'Join Official Server'. This will connect you to the official Wesnoth server, where you can join a game by selecting it, then selecting 'Join Game'.")}
