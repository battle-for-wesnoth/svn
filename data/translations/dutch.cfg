	choice1="Well, thank you for helping me get back to the surface, but now I must take what is mine!"
	choice10="No, I was thinking....and I don't really want to kill you. I have what I came to get, anyhow. How about if you promise to never come south of the great river, I spare your life?"
	choice11="With all respect, princess, I think it would be us doing the sparing, Sceptre or no Sceptre. Us doing the sparing, again, I might add."
	choice12="Such words in the presence of royalty! Do you want me to fry you, Elf?"
	choice13="Friends, peace! Though we are out of the tunnels, we are hardly safe. We are in the arid, wild north lands. We barely know where we are. Behold to the north, there are orcs. Look to the south, there are dark hordes. We must remain at peace with one another, or else all perish"
	choice14="I suppose that helping each other would be mutually beneficial for a while longer. But what should we do? How should we defend ourselves?"
	choice15="We have a choice to make. To the north passed the Orcs are the snow plains. To the south, beyond the Lichen armies is the Swamp of Dread."
	choice16="We certainly must go either north or south, for we must get out of this valley. Then we will be able to seek refuge in the ancient home of the North Elves."

	choice3="Did you think I was just playing around? I need to take my inheritance!"
	choice4="It is not so simple! We are back on the surface, but we are hardly safe. We barely know where we are, and Look to the north! There are orcs about! Look to the south, there are the hordes of the undead!"
	choice5="Indeed there are. We will have to fight our way out. Are you for us, princess, or against us?"
	choice6="Perhaps us remaining allies for a little longer is in both our best interests. But I do want that Sceptre, and someday I will have it!"
	choice7="Then we must devise a battle plan."
	choice8="Well, we got out alive."
	choice9="Yes we did. Now I suppose you want to use the Sceptre against me, princess?"

#	intro_1="In the twenty-seventh year of Garard II, king of Wesnoth, the kingdom was plunged into a bitter war with the Northern peoples."
#	intro_10="Asheviere took command of the army, and led it back to Weldyn. Realizing that the king's young nephews were next in succession to the throne, she ordered for them to all be killed, and declared herself the Queen Mother of Wesnoth."
#	intro_11="Hearing of the orders of Asheviere, Delfador entered the palace by stealth, and stole away Konrad, the youngest of Garard's nephews, saving him from death."
#	intro_12="Taking the child away to the forests of the West, Delfador raised him under the protection of the Elves, watching sadly as Asheviere's reign of terror over the land began..."
#	intro_13="... but one of the Orcs survived long enough to send the news to the queen..."
#	intro_2="The Northern host encamped at Galcadar, by the ford of Abez, and the king led his forces to meet them. Splitting his army in two, he led one half, and his son, the crown prince Eldred, led the other."
	intro_3="Eldred was a brave and courageous warrior, who could lead his soldiers well. Unfortunately for Garard, he was also ambitious.....and treacherous. In the heat of battle, the men of Eldred turned on their king. Garard was slain in battle that day, along with his brother, and all his sons but Eldred."
#	intro_4="Garard's queen, Asheviere, looked on with glee, having come to watch the battle from a nearby hill. Surely her son would rule in a way that satisfied her lust for power far better than her husband had."
#	intro_5="The Northern king happily made peace with Eldred, in exchange for tribute. Eldred proclaimed himself king, and led his army back to Weldyn."
#	intro_6="But Garard's arch-mage, Delfador, escaped the battle, and riding with haste, arrived at Weldyn first. He mustered a force of loyalists to fight Eldred, and avenge the king's death."
#	intro_7="Eldred entered the battle with clear advice from his mother in his mind: fight no-one great or small except the old mage, whose head should be severed from his shoulders."
#	intro_8="Eldred did indeed meet Delfador face-to-face in battle. Sword clashed against staff. The enwisened mage against the young, strong, brash warrior."
#	intro_9="Delfador's men lost the battle, and were routed, but Asheviere found her son's body, pinned to the ground by Delfador's staff."

# msg10_10="If this is true, Konrad, perhaps we should take another route and go around the mountain, rather then to try and Verslagen these new foes."
# msg10_11="What say you, Delfador?"
# msg10_12="No! We do not have the time to waste, we make for top of the pass, beware of mountain trolls, and do not stray too close to the water!"
# msg10_13="The shinsplitters will aid you in your quest, look, they arise from the villages to the east, the mighty shinsplitters!!! To battle!"
# msg10_2="Look Konrad, before us lies the great road built by the dwarves!"
# msg10_20="Well, we have Verslagened our foes let us hope the mountain does not Verslagen us!"
# msg10_21="I wish you all the best on your journey, I must return to my village and take care of my family, dwarven hospitality will welcome you, wherever you go friends!"
# msg10_22="Let us move onward!"
# msg10_3a="But, I can hardly see, with all this mist around!"
# msg10_4b="We must be wary... they say a wizard lives in these mountains, and he does not take kindly to visitors. It is he who causes the mists, to cause travellers to become lost, and then his creatures devour them."
# msg10_5b="His....creatures? We must keep to the road men!"
# msg10_6b="He is said to be a mighty foe, Konrad. It is said when the dwarves built this road, they disturbed the resting place of the ancient mage, and ever since he and his brother have travelled the mountain, wreacking havoc on the dwarven villages."
# msg10_7b="Let us go carefully but quickly then, men!"
# msg10_9="Greetings travellers, I am Stalrag, chief of the these villages! I warn you, a great wizard and his trolls are in the mountains and will surely attack, I will summon my tribesmen to aid ye!"
# msg10a_20="Aaargh! I am done for! Fight on without me brethren!"
# msg11_1="The doors are closed and barred from the inside!"
# msg11_10="The legend was true! There are always tentacled creatures hidding in the lakes near the Dwarven Kingdoms"
# msg11_11="At last, this is the entrance to the dwarven kingdom."
# msg11_12="All can I see are ruins and poor villages."
# msg11_13="The poor villagers that lived here trading with the dwarves are now under slavery of the orcs."
# msg11_14="Under slavery to the evil orcs? We must liberate them!"
# msg11_15="It's not a wise option, our mission is to retreive the Scepter of Fire. If we delay our march here hordes of orcs will surround us."
# msg11_16="Konrad, hear the words of Defaldor, we'll be back and then the grip of the orcs will be lifted from the lands."
# msg11_17="I'm not happy about this but I see the need to hurry."
# msg11_2b="We can't get in! What should we do now?"
# msg11_3="It is said that the orcs used an old mine tunnel to surprise the dwarves. It must be that one in the north-east."
# msg11_4="We must make it to the mine tunnel then!"
# msg11_5a="There is no time for delay or idle chatter, onward!"
# msg11_5b="I am hesitant to enter. It will be so difficult in the darkness!"
# msg11_6="The defense of the dwarves should have been strong. Look at those ruined towers!"
# msg11_7="The battle outside was fierce and lasted half a year, but the battles inside the tunnels were worse."
# msg11_9="A monster was hiding in that lake!"
# msg11_9a="Ruarrrrr!!!"
# msg12_1="It's so dark in here! I can hardly see!"
# msg12_10="You go too far! I am Kalenz, a mighty Elvish lord! How dare such as you, snivelling around in his tunnel, dare to call me a coward?"
# msg12_11="Peace friends! Peace! The evil Orcs roam the lands above us, must we also fight among ourselves?"
# msg12_12="Very well! Who are you? Explain your presence here then, human. Why have you risked life and limb to come to Knalga, the home of the Dwarves?"
# msg12_13="Well, we....we..."
# msg12_14="We have come so that an heir may claim his inheritance. That a king may claim his throne. We seek the Sceptre of Fire."
# msg12_15="The Sceptre of Fire? Are you out of your mind? Surely you speak but only in jest!"
# msg12_16="We jest not, friend. We seek the Sceptre of Fire. We seek the help of the Dwarves in finding it. Choose to help us not, if you so wish. We will find it, whether you help us or not."
# msg12_17="Your speech is like that of a fool. No-one even knows if the Sceptre of Fire exists. Who is this heir, this king that you speak of, anyhow?"
# msg12_18="I am, Sir."
# msg12_19="You, haha, this boy that stands before me is the king of Wesnoth? Haha! I haven't had such a laugh in a long time. And whom are you, old man?"
# msg12_2="It is dark indeed. We shall have to light torches, and tread slowly and warily. Hopefully there are still Dwarves down here who can aid us!"
# msg12_20="I am Delfador. Delfador the Great, Arch Mage to King Garard, and Protector of his heir."
# msg12_21="You....you are Delfador? I have seen Delfador when I was but a young Dwarf, and I will tell you old man, you are not Delfador. Men! Take these liars out of my sight. Delfador perished many years ago."
# msg12_22="I am Delfador the Great! Any who dare oppose me shall perish!"
# msg12_23="You...you really are Delfador! But we had news that you were dead, years ago!"
# msg12_24="They thought I was dead. They hoped I was dead. Yet still, still I live."
# msg12_25="And you really think you can find, the Sceptre of Fire?"
# msg12_26="Yes we do. If you help us, friend, all the treasures of Knalga that we find are yours. We want only the Sceptre. It will be dangerous. Make no mistake about that: Dwarves will be killed, perhaps many Dwarves. But surely it is better than hiding from the Orcs like worms."
# msg12_27="You are right, friend. I will put my best men at your disposal. We know not where the Sceptre is though. Legend says it is hidden in the northern tunnels."
# msg12_28="Then to the northern tunnels we shall go!"
# msg12_29="Hmm...there seems to be a secret passage behind these rocks!"
# msg12_3="Indeed. Us Elves are not well-skilled in these dark pits."
# msg12_30="There is a great fortune in this chest of treasure! I can count two hundred pieces of gold!"
# msg12_5="Who are these that approach? Surface-dwellers! On guard men!"
# msg12_6="We come in peace, friends. We come in peace!"
# msg12_7="Oh do you? I see you are even accompanied by Elves. Can us Dwarves not live in peace without the treacherous Elves coming to bother us?"
# msg12_8="Why such harsh words, Dwarf? Elves have never done you any harm."
# msg12_9="Never done us any harm? Why I was there myself, when the Elves did not come to honor our alliance. Many Dwarves were slaughtered, and you cowardly Elves did nothing to help!"
# msg13_1="Alright Delfador, now that I have claimed the Scepter of Fire I am going to hold you to your promise."
# msg13_10="I knew you should've helped him!"
# msg13_11="So this is my fault!?! Nevermind! Let's just kill them!"
# msg13_12="Hail!  We've come in response to your message, the Queen has given us specific orders to help you deal with these humans once and for all. We're the vanguard that's been sent out from an entire army that's been ordered to deal with these miscreants!"
# msg13_13="This is a bad turn of events! We must finish them quickly and flee!  We are not capable of dealing with an entire army dedicated to wiping us out in our current condition!"
# msg13_14="We've slain our opposition! Now let us make haste!"
# msg13_15="They're attacking me boss! I gotta defend myself!"
# msg13_16="They're attacking me boss! I gotta defend myself!"
# msg13_2="Which one?"
# msg13_3="The sign says 'Guest's quarters'"
# msg13_4="Very well Konrad.  But the orcs must have contacted Asheviere about our trip into the mines, and I doubt she will trust them to take care of the job.  So make haste, and dispatch these beasts quickly, lest reinforcements arrive."
# msg13_5="The human and his friends have returned!  I will deal with them myself!"
# msg13_6="If your sure boss..."
# msg13_7="COURSE I'm sure worm! Do as your told!"
# msg13_8="Alright, alright! Sorry boss!"
# msg13_9="They killed the boss!"
# msg13_9a="Who goes there? Friend or foe?"
# msg13_9b="We are desperately trying to rid these tunnels of the foul Orcs! Please help us in our quest."
# msg13_9c="Ah, a foul Orc! Let us rid these tunnels of its kind!"
# msg13_9d="I did not know that the undead were in these pits!"
# msg13_9e="Who is this foul enemy that we fight?"
# msg13_9f="I am Lionel. I am the Lost General. I will avenge myself upon you all!"
# msg13_9g="Avenge? What have we done to you that you must avenge?"
# msg13_9h="Lionel? A General? I remember that name..."
# msg13_9i="Remember me do you? Aye. I was the king's finest general, sent down to these pits to retrieve the Sceptre. But the Orcs trapped me and my men in this cavern, to starve to death. The Dwarves were no help, leaving me to die. Now I will get revenge on you all!"
# msg13_die1="Argh! I am vanquished! But at least by worthy foes, instead of those foul Orcs."
# msg13_die2="Rest in peace, Lionel. The poor, lost general."
# msg13_die3="Though I am destroyed, my mission must be completed. Friends, the Sceptre further North of here, deep in the caverns. Better fortune to you in finding it than there was to me."
	msg1_1="Veertien jaar nadat Asheviere de troon besteeg, kreeg ze aandacht voor de Elven, die ze verachtte. Ork huurlingen werden geronseld en weggestuurd om de Elven ellende te brengen."
	msg1_10="Laat ze maar komen. We bestrijden ze met alles wat we hebben."
	msg1_11="Wees voorzichtig, Konrad! Zorg goed voor hem, Delfador!"
	msg1_12="En zo het begon..."
	msg1_13="Goed, we hebben het gehaald! Maar waar gaan we nu naar toe?"
	msg1_14="We reizen naar het zuiden en proberen naar het eiland van Anduin te komen. Hopelijk vinden we daar een onderkomen"
	msg1_15="Natuurlijk heb je gelijk, Delfador. Maar wat zal er met de Elven hier gebeuren?"
	msg1_16="De Elven zullen doorvechten. Ze zullen het misschien zelfs overleven. Maar het ziet er niet goed uit voor hen. Laat ons daar nu niet over spreken. Voorwaarts!"
	msg1_17="Succes, Konrad! Maak je geen zorgen over ons. We vechten zo goed we kunnen!"
	msg1_18="Ik....ik haal het niet meer"
	msg1_19="Prins...Je moet blijven vechten! Neeeee!"
	msg1_2="Meester Delfador! Kijk, Orks komen van alle richtingen! Wat moeten we doen?"
	msg1_20="Het is over, ik ben verloren...."
	msg1_21="Ik heb.... heb gefaald in mijn plicht om de prins te beschermen. Ik ben verslagen"
	msg1_22="Blijf leven! Delfador! Alstublieft, U mag niet dood!"
	msg1_23="Ugh"
	msg1_24="Oh nee! We zijn te langzaam geweest. Er komen versterkingen aan bij de Orks...."
	msg1_25="Sterf, schurk, sterf!"
	msg1_26="Alleen de dommen houden me tegen!"
	msg1_27="Ik ben Galdrad. Je moet eerst mij verslaan, voor je verder kan!"
	msg1_28="Alleen een gek durft het aan mij aan te vallen!"
	msg1_28a="Ik ben Delfador the Grote, wees klaar om te sterven!"
	msg1_29="Laat me door, etter!"
	msg1_3="Er zijn er teveel om te bevechten. We moeten ontsnappen!"
	msg1_30="Ze vernietigen ons huis!"
	msg1_31="Kijk niet terug! We moeten door en snel!"
	msg1_4="Maar waar naar toe? Dit is ons enige huis! En wat gebeurt er met de Elven?"
	msg1_5="We zullen tegen hen strijden, maar jij moet weg, Konrad. Het is van groot belang dat jij ontsnapt!"
	msg1_6="We gaan naar het zuiden. Misschien kunnen we het eiland van Anduin bereiken. Als we dat halen, dan zullen we zeker veilig zijn. Konrad, we moeten wat Elven inhuren om ons te helpen en dan moet je naar de wegwijzer in het noord-westen. Ik zal je beschermen!"
	msg1_7="Da's goed, laten we opschieten!"
	msg1_8="Val de Elven aan, bezet hun dorpen, laten we dit land claimen voor de Koningin!"
	msg1_9="Haha! We snijden die vieze Elven aan stukjes!"
	msg1b_1="Het zou mogelijk moeten zijn om aan boord van een schip te komen in de Zwartwater haven, maar het lijkt er op dat de Orks ook deze kant op komen. Een van mijn oude leerlingen heeft zich hier gevestigd - Ik weet zeker dat hij ons wil helpen."
	msg1b_10="Ik can u een schip aanbieden - ik heb het naar de open zee gestuurd met de ouderen en de kinderen, maar het zal snel weer terug zijn."
	msg1b_11="Dank U, meneer."
	msg1b_11b="Ik hoop alleen dat we het de volgende keer ook zo goed doen, als die vuile Orks ons weer aanvallen."
	msg1b_12="We moeten nu aan boord."
	msg1b_13="Ik heb gefaald voor de mensen van de Zwartwater haven...."
	msg1b_14="Zonder zijn hulp, kunnen de schepen niet krijgen. Er is geen hoop..."
	msg1b_2="Defaldor, sommige Orks volgen ons spoor! We moeten opschieten!"
	msg1b_3="Delfaldor, my oude meester, Uw komst brengt ons het licht van hoop. We hoorden dat de Orks in het Elvenbos aanvielen en dat sommige ook hier naar toe kwamen om ons aan te vallen. Onze verdediging is alleen nog zwak."
	msg1b_4="We zullen je helpen hen te bevechten."
	msg1b_5a="Ik zal een van mijn magiër sturen om jullie te helpen. Huur meer magiërs in, en misschien wat paardrijders, die voor ons zeer goed tegen de troon hebben gevochten. Ik zal een paar dagen nodig hebben om hulp te regelen."
	msg1b_6="The defenses are now summoned."
	msg1b_7="Waaaah!! Veel te veel magiërs, we moeten terugtrekken!"
	msg1b_8="Dank voor de hulp, vrienden."
	msg1b_9="We zoeken transport naar het eiland van Anduin."
# msg2_1="And so the party landed on the Isle of Anduin..."
# msg2_10="Have you not heard? Many mermen have been captured, and are being farmed as pearl harvesters at the Bay of Pearls. If only someone would rescue them!"
# msg2_11="Let us go and rescue them then!"
# msg2_12="My lord, it would be very dangerous..."
# msg2_13="I believe we could do it. We need to strike back at Asheviere somehow anyway..."
# msg2_14="Let us leave after we have rested then."
# msg2_2="So this is Anduin. It looks a little....desolate"
# msg2_3="I fear so, Konrad. It seems that the Orcs have come even here"
# msg2_4="Who is that? Oh, a party of elves has landed, we shall drive them back into the sea!"
# msg2_5="I did not think the Orcs would have come here. This island used to be so beautiful. We must recapture it! To arms!"
# msg2_6="Greetings friends, thank you for rescuing my island from the Orcs!"
# msg2_7="It was our duty, friend. I hope you will grant us refuge here now"
# msg2_8="Of course. The Orcs are brutal. Brutal. Especially what they are doing to the poor mermen."
# msg2_9="Oh, what are they doing to the mermen?"
# msg3_1="So this is the Bay of Pearls. It looks like they have those mermen working hard!"
# msg3_10="But...but...how can this be happening to me?"
# msg3_11="Who was that idiot?"
# msg3_12="Free at last! Now death to the Orcs!"
# msg3_13="Now that we are free, together we can Verslagen our oppressors!"
# msg3_13a="Death to the orcs! Come, let us all fight them men!"
# msg3_14="Freedom! Now where are those Orcs? Let me at em!"
# msg3_15="Thank you for rescuing us! Now we can help you fight the evil Orcs!
The main cage where they keep most of the mermen is in the south-east!"
# msg3_16="At last, we have freed the mermen. Go back to the ocean and leave in peace."
# msg3_17="My lord! You may need the help of some of us who have skill in the sea in future. We would like to offer you help, and come with you."
# msg3_18="Now where is Delfador? I hope he's ok!"
# msg3_19="Ok indeed, friend."
# msg3_2="Indeed it does. It also looks like they have many, many troops. I think that I should go around the bay, and distract some of them. You and the rest of our men rescue the mermen!"
# msg3_20="There you are! I am so glad you are alright! Now we may have a little rest."
# msg3_21="I am afraid there is no time for rest. Konrad, Asheviere has now laid siege to Elensefar, breaking the century-old treaty between Wesnoth and the Elense city-state. If the city falls, there's no telling how many other lands she may swallow up!"
# msg3_22="Oh no! What should we do?"
# msg3_23="You must lead our men to the city, and try to help defend it. Or recapture it if it falls before you arrive."
# msg3_24="I must do that? But what about you Delfador? You're coming with me right?"
# msg3_25="I am afraid not, Konrad. I have come across some important documents, and must make haste with them to the Elven Council. It seems that the time to stop Asheviere is shorter than I had thought."
# msg3_26="But Delfador! I can't do it on my own!"
# msg3_27="On your own? My lord! We your loyal soldiers will support you!"
# msg3_28="You will prevail. I have faith in you. Travel north. Elensefar is but three days travel if you make haste."
# msg3_29="Very well. Until we meet again, my dear friend!"
# msg3_3="Very well. Be careful!"
# msg3_30="Farewell, prince."
# msg3_4="But boss, why are we only using bats and nagas?"
# msg3_5="Because we need to control the seas and the merman folk, and nagas and bats are best for doing that!"
# msg3_6="But orcs are the most powerful race in all of..."
# msg3_7="Shut up worm! I'm the boss!"
# msg3_8="Hahaha! Now orcs will rule over land and sea!"
# msg3_9="(Sigh) will someone kill this idiot for me please?"
# msg4_1="But the road to Elensefar was a treacherous one. Konrad and his men were set upon by the fiends of the undead."
# msg4_10="Surprise! Searching for Mages, all I get is elves!"
# msg4_11="The temple seems to be empty."
# msg4_12a="It has been an honor to have helped you Verslagen the undead, my lord. I must now return to my home. I feel that our paths may cross again one day, perhaps when your need against the undead hordes is greater still."
# msg4_2="My lord! In yonder ruins there seems to be some movement!"
# msg4_3="It looks like there are the undead there! Prepare for battle men!"
# msg4_4="To arms!"
# msg4_5="Ahh, a party of Elves approaches. Soon we shall have Elven zombies serving us!"
# msg4_6="There are some ancient temples to the north-west, I wonder what might be inside them!"
# msg4_7="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
# msg4_8="I was hiding in this holy place planning how to Verslagen the evil undeads, now I with your help, we can destroy them."
# msg4_9="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
# msg4_moredie="Fight on against the undead without me, friends!"
# msg5_1="The party arrived at Elensefar at last, but found that the city had already fallen to the evil Orcs."
# msg5_10="Thieves hmmm? Who says we can trust such as you?"
# msg5_11="We would understand if you don't trust us, of course, but it is in both our best interests to rid the city of the Orcs!"
# msg5_12="Very well, you may join us."
# msg5_13="Finally, we have retaken the city! Let us rest here friends."
# msg5_14="Victory! The thieves of Elensefar will be in your service, my lord"
# msg5_15="The party rested for three days, after which an old friend returned"
# msg5_16="Greetings, friends. I see that you have rescued the city! I knew that you could do it."
# msg5_17="Delfador! So good to see you! Where have you been?"
# msg5_18="I have been meeting with the Great Elven Council. This is Kalenz, a lord of the Northern Elves who came to the Council to offer us the support of the North Elves"
# msg5_19="Greetings, friend."
# msg5_2="My lord! It seems the city has already fallen!"
# msg5_20="Delfador, we have captured this city, but surely Asheviere's men will come and attack us! What should we do?"
# msg5_21="The Council has met, and we have decided: we must capture the Sceptre of Fire"
# msg5_22="The Sceptre of Fire? What's that?"
# msg5_23="During the reign of Garard I, your uncle's father, the dwarves of Knalga agreed to make the king a magnificent scepter. It took their finest smiths years to make it. But soon after it was completed, Orcs invaded the tunnels of Knalga. Now Knalga is in chaos, and though some Dwarves still live in parts of it, always at war with the Orcs, the sceptre was lost somewhere in the great caverns."
# msg5_24="Oh, but what has this to do with me?"
# msg5_25="Garard II, your uncle, was deciding upon a successor. He issued an edict that whichever member of the royal family could retrieve the Sceptre of Fire would rule the land."
# msg5_26="Oh, and you want me to get this sceptre?"
# msg5_26a="We will help you get it, my lord."
# msg5_27="Time is short. We think that Asheviere is also searching for the Sceptre, to help seal her place as ruler. If you get the Sceptre first though, the people will support you as the king."
# msg5_28="Me? The king?"
# msg5_29="Yes Konrad. I believe you will be king one day. Now let us make haste!"
# msg5_3="This is terrible news! We must retake the city!"
# msg5_4="There are so many of them. This will not be easy! And look to the south, it seems that the undead are allied with the Orcs!"
# msg5_5="Here come the Elves! With our newly forged alliance with the Orcs, we will crush them with ease!"
# msg5_6="We must take the city, and destroy the evil undead before reinforcements arrive!"
# msg5_7="In the night, three dark figures crept out of the forest"
# msg5_8="Halt! Who goes there? Friend or foe?"
# msg5_9="Greetings, friend. We are from the Elensefar Thieves Guild. We would like to help you against the Orcs!"
# msg6_1="On the road to Knalga, the party was opposed by the forces of Asheviere"
# msg6_10="Halt! You shall not pass!"
# msg6_11="My duty is to kill you!"
# msg6_12="Get out!"
# msg6_13="Protect me!"
# msg6_14="Yes, madam!"
# msg6_15="Don't move!"
# msg6_16="Stay away!"
# msg6_17="Don't move!"
# msg6_18="They bear down on me quickly! I had better use some magical aid."
# msg6_19="They took that village too! I'll make them retreat!"
# msg6_2="The Queen has sent me to stop you, you imposter!"
# msg6_20="If swords won't destroy them, magic will do."
# msg6_21="Fry them!"
# msg6_22="You get paid to kill them, so go!"
# msg6_23="Somebody! Kill these intruders, now!"
# msg6_24="Uggh will kill the slims!"
# msg6_25="Ogres! I need more ogres to Verslagen them!"
# msg6_26="Surely an ogre will crush them!"
# msg6_27="I surrender! Don't hurt me, imposter."
# msg6_28="I said before I'm not an imposter, but if you yield, I will spare your life."
# msg6_29="Let me go!"
# msg6_3="That's the princess, Li'sar. The daughter of the Queen, and her successor!"
# msg6_30="Think about the story of the old king, ask somebody old about it."
# msg6_31="The old king? I have heard about that, but I know it's not true. My mother told me."
# msg6_32="Your mother has lied to you, child. Now I suggest you reconsider, and either join us, or flee into exile. There will be a great battle soon, and if you are on the wrong side of it, we may not have the opportunity to spare your life a second time."
# msg6_33="I'm not a child, and I don't want to talk about it! Now you said you would spare me, so be on your way. The northern road should be safe for you."
# msg6_34="Good day, princess. Come men, to the northern road!"
# msg6_35="(hehe, little do they know just how many undead have wandered the northern road of late. Surely they are doomed!)"
# msg6_36="No! It can't end like this!"
# msg6_37="Argh! I have been Verslagened!"
# msg6_38="With Kalenz slain, it is hopeless. We are Verslagened."
# msg6_4="I'm no imposter, it seems that your mother has lied to you about it."
# msg6_5="It's no use reasoning. There is only one thing she will understand. To arms!"
# msg6_6="This is taking too much time, I best call some reinforcements!"
# msg6_7="Maybe I wasn't using enough forces..."
# msg6_8="Protect the princess!!!"
# msg6_9="Stop!!!"
# msg7_1="My lord! This road does not seem as safe as we had hoped, look around us at the hills, there are undead about!"
# msg7_10="Whew! They seem to be retreating at last!"
# msg7_11="Yes! We have fought them off"
# msg7_12a="This place makes me feel uneasy, even with the undead retreating. Where may we go now?"
# msg7_12b="Thank you for returning to help us, Moremirmu."
# msg7_12c="It greatly saddens me that Moremirmu was slain on the field, after he returned to help us."
# msg7_13a="The land of Wesnoth is not safe for us. The Queen's forces reach every corner. We must make haste to the north lands, across the great river. Let us go quickly!"
# msg7_13b="It is both my duty and pleasure, my lord! We were dining with some royal guards of the princess, taking a rest from our pilgrimage, when they spoke of how you were tricked into travelling these dangerous lands. We could do nothing but help you!"
# msg7_13c="May he rest peacefully!"
# msg7_14a="Indeed! Let us go from here!"
# msg7_14b="So, she tricked us into coming this way on purpose! Where may we go now? Which way will be safe for us?"
# msg7_14c="He died fighting for you, prince, just as any of us would be willing to die, fighting for you."
# msg7_15b="You must get out of the clutches of that vile Queen, my lord. If you take a course, bearing north-east, on past the mountain of gryphons, you will be able to ford the great river at Abez. Make haste though, for you will not be able to ford the river come winter!"
# msg7_16b="Thank you for your counsel, good friend! May our paths meet again in happier times!"
# msg7_2="Who are these who approach? Let us kill them all!"
# msg7_3="To arms men! The undead hordes approach!"
# msg7_4="There are just so many! Whatever shall we do?"
# msg7_5="Just let us hold them off for as long as we can!"
# msg7_6b="I have come once again to aid you friends!"
# msg7_7b="White mages? Come to help us? But what are they doing here?"
# msg7_8b="That is Moremirmu! He helped us fight Muff Malal, let us hope he can help us once more!"
# msg8_1a="What is this place? That is a tall mountain!"
# msg8_2b="That is the fabled Gryphon Mountain! We must be careful here, disturbing the gryphons could prove to be dangerous."
# msg8_3b="So this is Gryphon Mountain! Maybe we could steal some eggs from the gryphons and breed them as flying mounts? Would that work Delfador?"
# msg8_4b="We can try to do that, although it may be dangerous indeed! But perhaps the use of gryphons could help us greatly later on. Anyhow, we do have to pass by this place regardless."
# msg8_5b="Well, let's start climbing that mountain!"
# msg8_5c="It appears we are not the only ones who are interested in this mountain. Once again the Queen opposes us!"
# msg8_5d="Quickly men! Onward!"
# msg8_6="We have Verslagened them! Now what do we do?"
# msg8_7="We must continue north. It is too late to return to the safety of Elensefar or Anduin before winter befalls us. Thus we must cross the great river and continue toward the land of the Dwarves. Come let us go!"
# msg8_8="With these gryphon eggs we should be able to breed gryphons that will serve us. That will let us hire gryphon riders!"
# msg8_9b="Let us continue onward!"
# msg9_1="This is the Ford of Abez. When we ford this river, we will be leaving Wesnoth, and entering the lands of the North. The lands the Dwarves once ruled, but which are now filled only with chaos. This is where your father and uncle were betrayed to their deaths, almost nineteen years ago now, Konrad."
# msg9_10="That foolish boy killed himself."
# msg9_11="What do you mean?"
# msg9_12="I mustered men to fight against the traitor-king, and of course Asheviere, the one behind it all. We were out numbered, perhaps four-to-one. In the heat of battle, that boy, that foolish boy, came charging at me, slashing wildly. I had little choice but to end him."
# msg9_13b="So it is true, that you did kill him?"
# msg9_14b="He did die in battle, at my hand. It is sad that your brothers did not have the opportunity to experience such an 'honorable' death, Konrad."
# msg9_16="With all respect my lords, we must make haste. We have to ford the river as a matter of urgency. Look! It seems that the guard towers on the river banks are guarded!"
# msg9_17="Look! Some of the southerners, the men of Wesnoth are trying to cross into our lands! We will have to stop them men!"
# msg9_18="Isn't there somewhere else we can cross? Maybe upstream?"
# msg9_19="Winter bears down on us fast. We have only a few days to make the crossing, and the nearest bridge is far upstream. To be trapped south of the river when winter arrives would be suicidal, Asheviere would have us like rats! Look to the west! Asheviere has a border fort here, and it seems to be full of soldiers! We must cross here, and quickly!"
# msg9_19b="There they are! So it is true, they foiled the undead. Now they are trying to leave Wesnoth. We can't let them cross the river. After them men!"
# msg9_2="Really? So what happened, Delfador?"
# msg9_20a="Not her again! Quick, we must make haste!"
# msg9_3="The forces of the king were encamped here. The forces of the north were camped on the north side of the river. For three days and three nights the armies faced each other, neither one willing to ford the river. On the fourth day, the northern armies crossed the river, and attacked us."
# msg9_4b="And then....we were Verslagened?"
# msg9_5="We were winning the battle. We were repelling them."
# msg9_6="Until the king's son, in the heat of battle, until he turned on the king!"
# msg9_7b="But you avenged the murder. You killed the prince, right Delfador?"
# msg9_8="When I saw the king betrayed and his banner fall, I fled the battle. Be it wisdom or be it cowardice, I fled the battle, seeing us have no hope that day."
# msg9_9b="Oh, but the Elves always told me that you killed the prince, Delfador, even though you never talked about it."
# msg9_a1="Ruaarrrrrrrr!"
# msg9_a2="What is that?"
# msg9_a3="Creatures of the deep are upon us! This may be very dangerous. Quick, we must get to the other side as fast as we can!"
# msg9_a4="We have made it across the river safely! Where to now?"
# msg9_a5="We must continue north. We must seek help with the northern Dwarves if we are to stand a hope of penetrating into Knalga."
# msg9_a6="They have made it away! I cannot believe it! We must make chase after them over the river! We will meet again, foul imposter!"
# msg9_a7="Do you think she's really going to chase us Delfador?"
# msg9_a8="It surely looks like she will try, but the sea creatures will make it difficult for her. We must continue onward. If she makes it across before winter, then so be it!"
# msg_delfador_die="No! This is the end! We have been Verslagened!"
# msg_doors_lisar="Whew! We make our way through the dangerous fog of the mountains, and now there is all this chaos before us! Come on men! We must make it into the mines, for they are still ahead of us!"
# msg_kalenz_die="Argh! I am finished with!"
# msg_konrad_die="We are vanquished, for I have been Verslagened!"
# msg_lisar_die="I can't believe it should end like this!"
# msgcrossroads1="Stay on the path!"
# msgcrossroads2="Stay out of the forrest!"
# msgnw_1="This winter is bitterly cold! Perhaps we should stop here and rest a while."
# msgnw_10="And so after many days of rest, the party set out once again for the Dwarven kingdom..."
# msgnw_2="Stop and rest? My lord, we must go hard after the Sceptre of Fire, lest it fall into the hands of our enemies!"
# msgnw_3="We have beaten a hard march ever since we were besieged by the undead in that foul valley. Now winter bears down upon us, and we have spent most of our money. This land looks fertile enough: surely we can settle here for the winter!"
# msgnw_4b="Yes, let us rest a while! I am sure there are many challenges ahead, and I do not think I could endure another challenge equal to the fording of the river for many days."
# msgnw_5="We are chasing the Sceptre of Fire, the fate of the realm is in our hands, and you humans want to stop and rest? Onward I say!"
# msgnw_6="They are right, Kalenz. I had wanted to attain the Sceptre within a moon, but it is not to be. Our soldiers will begin to desert if we don't rest soon. But in these wild north lands, we must fight even for the right to rest. Look to the north! Those foul orcs will not allow us to rest in peace!"
# msgnw_7="Then we shall wrest control of the land from them. To arms men!"
# msgnw_8="Victory is ours! We have secured the land from the Orcs. Now we can rest here while the cold winter passes."
# msgnw_9="Let us not rest for too long though, friends: we must still reach the ancient Dwarven lands before our foes do."
# msgsnowplains1="These fields of snow were once home of the Ice Elves. They moved on many decades ago. Legends say the left a great sword of fire behind."
# msgsnowplains2="This sword may prove useful on our journy ahead. It must be in one of the towns before us."
# msgswamp1="This land is cursed. The Lichen have lived here for years amassing great armies and fortunes."
# msgswamp2="The Lichen are all over this swamp. I hope I have made a wise choice to come down this path."
# msgswamp3="Each of the Lichen leaders will have a pile of gold you can take, if they are Verslagened. Don't stretch you armies to thin though, we still must pass threw this swamp to the north."

	tut12="Welke type manschappen moet ik inhuren, Delfador?"
	tut13="Je moet goed naar hun vaardigheden kijken. Eerst wil je snelle manschappen, die voor je zo veel mogelijk dorpen veroveren. Daarna maken waarschijnlijk de elf-soldaten het grootste gedeelte van je leger uit. Denk er aan dat elven heel goed vechten in het bos. Paardrijders zijn prima op open grond. Magiërs zijn een goede ondersteuning en kunnen bijna hetzelfde worden ingezet als boogschutters. Als magiërs meer ervaren worden, dan worden ze erg machtig."
	tut14="Als je een vijand aanvalt, dan kan je kiezen welk wapen je wil gebruiken. Je kan dan de kans bekijken op raken en geraakt worden en hoeveel schade dat doet."

	tut3="Uhh...ok, hoe begin ik?"
	tut4="Je hebt twee honderd goudstukken om soldaten in te huren, en het is het eerste dat je zou moeten doen (rechter-muis-klik en selekteer 'Inhuren'). Je kan alleen soldaten inhuren, wanneer je in je kasteel bent, dus het is belangrijk dat je het niet te vroeg verlaat."
	tut5="Ok, ik denk dat ik er klaar voor ben. Laten we beginnen!"
	tut6="Natuurlijk huur ik soldaten in om tegen de jouwe te vechten"
	tut7="Ok. Maar hoe krijg ik meer geld om soldaten in te huren?"
	tut8="Als je één van je soldaten in een dorp zet, komt het onder controle van jou. Elk dorp geeft je elke beurt twee goudstukken. Elke soldaat kost je een goudstuk per beurt."
	tut9="Dus het is belangrijk om de controle over veel dorpen te krijgen, zodat ik veel geld krijg om veel soldaten in te huren?"
