	intro_1="W dwudziestym siódmym wieku Gararda II, króla Wesnothu, królestwo pogr±¿y³o siê w zaciêtej wojnie z lud¼mi Pó³nocy."
	intro_10="Asheviere took command of the army, and led it back to Weldyn. Realizing that the king's young nephews were next in succession to the throne, she ordered for them to all be killed, and declared herself the Queen Mother of Wesnoth"
	intro_11="Hearing of the orders of Asheviere, Delfador entered the palace by stealth, and stole away Konrad, the youngest of Garard's nephews, saving him from death"
	intro_12="Taking the child away to the forests of the West, Delfador raised him under the protection of the Elves, watching sadly as Asheviere's reign of terror over the land began..."
	intro_2="Pó³nocny orszak rozbi³ obóz w Galcadar, w pobli¿u brodu Abez, dok±d król poprowadzi³ swoje si³y aby stoczyæ walkê. Podzieliwszy armiê na dwie poprowadzi³ jedn± jej czê¶æ, dowództwo drugiej oddaj±c w rêce swego syna Eldreda, ksiêcia korony."
	intro_3="Eldred was a brave and courageous warrior, who could lead his soldiers well. Unfortunately for Garard, he was also ambitious.....and treacherous. In the heat of battle, the men of Eldred turned on their king. Garard was slain in battle that day, along with his brother, and all his sons but Eldred"
	intro_4="Garard's queen, Asheviere, looked on with glee, having come to watch the battle from a nearby hill. Surely her son would rule in a way that satisfied her lust for power far better than her husband had."
	intro_5="The Northern king happily made peace with Eldred, in exchange for tribute. Eldred proclaimed himself king, and led his army back to Weldyn."
	intro_6="But Garard's arch-mage, Delfador, escaped the battle, and riding with haste, arrived at Weldyn first. He mustered a force of loyalists to fight Eldred, and avenge the king's death."
	intro_7="Eldred entered the battle with clear advice from his mother in his mind: fight no-one great or small except the old mage, whose head should be severed from his shoulders."
	intro_8="Eldred did indeed meet Delfador face-to-face in battle. Sword clashed against staff. The enwisened mage against the young, strong, brash warrior."
	intro_9="Delfador's men lost the battle, and were routed, but Asheviere found her son's body, pinned to the ground by Delfador's staff."

	msg1_1="Fourteen years after Asheviere began her reign, she turned her attention to the Elves, whom she despised. Orcish mercenaries were hired and dispatched to bring about the ruin of the Elves."
	msg1_10="Let them come. We will fight them with all we have!"
	msg1_11="Be careful Konrad! Guard him well, Delfador!"
	msg1_12="And so it has begun"
	msg1_13="Okay, we have made it this far! But where do we go next?"
	msg1_14="We must travel north, and try to make it to the Isle of Anduin. Hopefully there we will find refuge."
	msg1_15="Of course you are right, Delfador. But what will become of the Elves here?"
	msg1_16="The Elves will fight. They may even prevail. But I fear things do not bode well for them. Let us not speak of it now. Onward!"
	msg1_17="Good luck Konrad! Don't worry about us, we will fight as best we can!"
	msg1_18="I....I don't think I can make it anymore"
	msg1_19="Prince...you must keep fighting! Nooooooo!"
	msg1_2="Master Delfador! Look, there are Orcs coming from all directions! What shall we do?"
	msg1_20="It is over, I am doomed...."
	msg1_21="I have....have failed in my duty to protect the prince, I am defeated"
	msg1_22="Don't die! Delfador! Please, you have to stay alive!"
	msg1_23="Ugh"
	msg1_24="Oh no! We have run out of time, they have arrived with reinforcements..."
	msg1_25="Die villain, die!"
	msg1_26="Only the foolish oppose me!"
	msg1_27="I am Galdrad. You will have to fight me to get any further!"
	msg1_28="You shall not pass!"
	msg1_29="Let me through you rogue!"
	msg1_3="There are too many to fight. Far too many. We must escape!"
	msg1_4="But to where? This is the only home we have! What about the Elves?"
	msg1_5="We will fight them, but you must escape, Konrad. It is imperative that you escape!"
	msg1_6="We will go north. Perhaps we can reach the Isle of Anduin. If we can make it there, surely we will be safe. Konrad, we must recruit some Elves to help us, and then you must make it to the sign post in the north-west. I will protect you!"
	msg1_7="Very well, let us hurry!"
	msg1_8="Attack the Elves men, take their villages, let us claim this land for the Queen!"
	msg1_9="Haha! We will rip the filthy Elves to pieces!"
	msg2_1="And so the party landed on the Isle of Anduin..."
	msg2_10="Have you not heard? Many mermen have been captured, and are being farmed as pearl harvesters at the Bay of Pearls. If only someone would rescue them!"
	msg2_11="Let us go and rescue them then!"
	msg2_12="My lord, it would be very dangerous..."
	msg2_13="I believe we could do it. We need to strike back at Asheviere somehow anyway..."
	msg2_14="Let us leave after we have rested then."
	msg2_2="So this is Anduin. It looks a little....desolate"
	msg2_3="I fear so, Konrad. It seems that the Orcs have come even here"
	msg2_4="Who is that? Oh, a party of elves has landed, we shall drive them back into the sea!"
	msg2_5="I did not think the Orcs would have come here. This island used to be so beautiful. We must recapture it! To arms!"
	msg2_6="Greetings friends, thank you for rescuing my island from the Orcs!"
	msg2_7="It was our duty, friend. I hope you will grant us refuge here now"
	msg2_8="Of course. The Orcs are brutal. Brutal. Especially what they are doing to the poor mermen."
	msg2_9="Oh, what are they doing to the mermen?"
	msg3_1="So this is the Bay of Pearls. It looks like they have those mermen working hard!"
	msg3_10="But...but...how can this be happening to me?"
	msg3_11="Who was that idiot?"
	msg3_12="Free at last! Now death to the Orcs!"
	msg3_13="Now that we are free, together we can defeat our oppressors!"
	msg3_14="Freedom! Now where are those Orcs? Let me at em!"
	msg3_15="Thank you for rescuing us! Now we can help you fight the evil Orcs!"
	msg3_16="At last, we have freed the mermen. Go back to the ocean and leave in peace."
	msg3_17="My lord! You may need the help of some of us who have skill in the sea in future. We would like to offer you help, and come with you."
	msg3_18="Now where is Delfador? I hope he's ok!"
	msg3_19="Ok indeed, friend."
	msg3_2="Indeed it does. It also looks like they have many, many troops. I think that I should go around the bay, and distract some of them. You and the rest of our men rescue the mermen!"
	msg3_20="There you are! I am so glad you are alright! Now we may have a little rest."
	msg3_21="I am afraid there is no time for rest. Konrad, Asheviere has now laid siege to Elensefar, breaking the century-old treaty between Wesnoth and the Elense city-state. If the city falls, there's no telling how many other lands she may swallow up!"
	msg3_22="Oh no! What should we do?"
	msg3_23="You must lead our men to the city, and try to help defend it - or recapture it if it falls before you arrive."
	msg3_24="I must do that? But what about you Delfador? You're coming with me right?"
	msg3_25="I am afraid not, Konrad. I have come across some important documents, and must make haste with them to the Elven Council. It seems that the time to stop Asheviere is shorter than I had thought."
	msg3_26="But Delfador! I can't do it on my own!"
	msg3_27="On your own? My lord! We your loyal soldiers will support you!"
	msg3_28="You will prevail. I have faith in you. Travel north. Elensefar is but three days travel if you make haste."
	msg3_29="Very well. Until we meet again, my dear friend!"
	msg3_3="Very well. Be careful!"
	msg3_30="Farewell, prince."
	msg3_4="But boss, why are we only using bats and nagas?"
	msg3_5="Because we need to control the seas and the merman folk, and nagas and bats are best for doing that!"
	msg3_6="But orcs are the most powerful race in all of..."
	msg3_7="Shut up worm! I'm the boss!"
	msg3_8="Hahaha! Now orcs will rule over land and sea!"
	msg3_9="(Sigh) will someone kill this idiot for me please?"
	msg4_1="But the road to Elensefar was a treacherous one. Konrad and his men were set upon by the fiends of the undead."
	msg4_10="Surprise! Searching for Mages, all I get is elves!"
	msg4_11="The temple seems to be empty."
	msg4_12="It has been an honor to have helped you defeat the undead, my lord. I must now return to my home."
	msg4_2="My lord! In yonder ruins there seems to be some movement!"
	msg4_3="It looks like there are the undead there! Prepare for battle men!"
	msg4_4="To arms!"
	msg4_5="Ahh, a party of Elves approaches. Soon we shall have Elven zombies serving us!"
	msg4_6="There are some ancient temples to the north-west, I wonder what might be inside them!"
	msg4_7="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
	msg4_8="I was hiding in this holy place planning how to defeat the evil undeads, now I with your help, we can destroy them."
	msg4_9="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
	msg5_1="The party arrived at Elensefar at last, but found that the city had already fallen to the evil Orcs."
	msg5_10="Thieves hmmm? Who says we can trust such as you?"
	msg5_11="We would understand if you don't trust us, of course, but it is in both our best interests to rid the city of the Orcs!"
	msg5_12="Very well, you may join us."
	msg5_13="Finally, we have retaken the city! Let us rest here friends."
	msg5_14="Victory! The thieves of Elensefar will be in your service, my lord"
	msg5_15="The party rested for three days, after which an old friend returned"
	msg5_16="Greetings, friends. I see that you have rescued the city! I knew that you could do it."
	msg5_17="Delfador! So good to see you! Where have you been?"
	msg5_18="I have been meeting with the Great Elven Council. This is Kalenz, a lord of the Northern Elves who came to the Council to offer us the support of the North Elves"
	msg5_19="Greetings, friend."
	msg5_2="My lord! It seems the city has already fallen!"
	msg5_20="Delfador, we have captured this city, but surely Asheviere's men will come and attack us! What should we do?"
	msg5_21="The Council has met, and we have decided: we must capture the Sceptre of Fire"
	msg5_22="The Sceptre of Fire? What's that?"
	msg5_23="During the reign of Garard I, your uncle's father, the dwarves of Knalga agreed to make the king a magnificent scepter. It took their finest smiths years to make it. But soon after it was completed, Orcs invaded the tunnels of Knalga. Now Knalga is in chaos, and though some Dwarves still live in parts of it, always at war with the Orcs, the sceptre was lost somewhere in the great caverns."
	msg5_24="Oh, but what has this to do with me?"
	msg5_25="Garard II, your uncle, was deciding upon a successor. He issued an edict that whichever member of the royal family could retrieve the Sceptre of Fire would rule the land."
	msg5_26="Oh, and you want me to get this sceptre?"
	msg5_27="Time is short. We think that Asheviere is also searching for the Sceptre, to help seal her place as ruler. If you get the Sceptre first though, the people will support you as the king."
	msg5_28="Me? The king?"
	msg5_29="Yes Konrad. I believe you will be king one day. Now let us make haste!"
	msg5_3="This is terrible news! We must retake the city!"
	msg5_4="There are so many of them. This will not be easy! And look to the south, it seems that the undead are allied with the Orcs!"
	msg5_5="Here come the Elves! With our newly forged alliance with the Orcs, we will crush them with ease!"
	msg5_6="We must take the city, and destroy the evil undead before reinforcements arrive!"
	msg5_7="In the night, three dark figures crept out of the forest"
	msg5_8="Halt! Who goes there? Friend or foe?"
	msg5_9="Greetings, friend. We are from the Elensefar Thieves Guild. We would like to help you against the Orcs!"
	msg6_1="On the road to Knalga, the party was opposed by the forces of Asheviere"
	msg6_10="Halt! You shall not pass!"
	msg6_11="My duty is to kill you!"
	msg6_12="Get out!"
	msg6_13="Protect me!"
	msg6_14="Yes, madam!"
	msg6_15="Don't move!"
	msg6_16="Stay away!"
	msg6_17="Don't move!"
	msg6_18="They bear down on me quickly! I had better use some magical aid."
	msg6_19="They took that village too! I'll make them retreat!"
	msg6_2="The Queen has sent me to stop you, you imposter!"
	msg6_20="If swords won't destroy them, magic will do."
	msg6_21="Fry them!"
	msg6_22="You get paid to kill them, so go!"
	msg6_23="Somebody! Kill these intruders, now!"
	msg6_24="Uggh will kill the slims!"
	msg6_25="Ogres! I need more ogres to defeat them!"
	msg6_26="Surely an ogre will crush them!"
	msg6_27="I surrender! Don't hurt me, imposter."
	msg6_28="I said before I'm not an imposter, but if you yield, I will spare your life."
	msg6_29="Let me go!"
	msg6_3="That's the princess, Li'sar. The Queen adopted her, and rumour has it that she is raising her to be her successor!"
	msg6_30="Think about the story of the old king, ask somebody old about it."
	msg6_31="The old king? I have heard about that, but I know it's not true. My mother told me."
	msg6_32="Your mother has lied to you, child. Now I suggest you reconsider, and either join us, or flee into exile. There will be a great battle soon, and if you are on the wrong side of it, we may not have the opportunity to spare your life a second time."
	msg6_33="I'm not a child, and I don't want to talk about it! Now you said you would spare me, so be on your way. The northern road should be safe for you."
	msg6_34="Good day, princess. Come men, to the northern road!"
	msg6_35="(hehe, little do they know just how many undead have wandered the northern road of late. Surely they are doomed!)"
	msg6_36="No! It can't end like this!"
	msg6_37="Argh! I have been defeated!"
	msg6_38="With Kalenz slain, it is hopeless. We are defeated."
	msg6_4="I'm no imposter, it seems that your mother has lied to you about it."
	msg6_5="It's no use reasoning. There is only one thing she will understand. To arms!"
	msg6_6="This is taking too much time, I best call some reinforcements!"
	msg6_7="Maybe I wasn't using enough forces..."
	msg6_8="Protect the princess!!!"
	msg6_9="Stop!!!"
	msg7_1="My lord! This road does not seem as safe as we had hoped, look around us at the hills, there are undead about! "
	msg7_10="Whew! They seem to be retreating at last!"
	msg7_11="Yes! We have fought them off"
	msg7_12="Now, why did you lie to us and tell us this way was safe, and why did you now save us, young lady?"
	msg7_13="Well, I uhh...well I wanted you to all die after you defeated me, but then I felt guilty about it, and decided I better help you!"
	msg7_14="And where are all your men?"
	msg7_15="Well I left them! I snuck away with a few of my most loyal men. I've decided I don't want to succeed my mother. She would have happily let you all die, but I realized that I just couldn't do that."
	msg7_16="So are you going to join us now?"
	msg7_17="Ohhh, may I, sir?"
	msg7_18="Yes you may, child."
	msg7_19="I can see that our work is done here. We must return to our pilgrimage!"
	msg7_2="Who are these who approach? Let us kill them all!"
	msg7_20="I can't believe it should end like this!"
	msg7_21="Argh! I am finished with!"
	msg7_22="No! This is the end! We have been defeated!"
	msg7_3="To arms men! The undead hordes approach!"
	msg7_4="There are just so many! Whatever shall we do?"
	msg7_5="Just let us hold them off for as long as we can!"
	msg7_6="I have come to aid you, friends!"
	msg7_7="What on earth are you doing here?"
	msg7_8="Never mind that now! Let's fight them off!"
	msg7_9="We also have come to help. When the princess told us of your great need against the undead, we offered our services."
	msg8_1="That is the famous Gryphon Mountain! Maybe if we could capture some gryphon pups or get some of their eggs we could train them as mounts!"
	msg8_2="My lord Konrad, we have to be very carefull, disturbing the monsters in their nest could be very dangerous."
	msg8_3="Nice idea, Konrad! I love flying mounts!"
	msg8_4="Well, everybody, let start climbing that mountain."
	msg8_5="Fools, we could ambush them while they're fighting the monsters."
	msg8_6="We have defeated them! Now what do we do?"
	msg8_7="We must continue north. It is too late to return to the safety of Elensefar or Anduin before winter befalls us. Thus we must cross the great river and continue toward the land of the Dwarves. Come let us go!"
	msg8_8="With these gryphon eggs we should be able to breed gryphons that will serve us. That will let us hire gryphon riders!"
	msg8_9="Onward men!"
	msg9_1="This is the Ford of Abez. It is where your father and uncle were betrayed to their deaths, almost nineteen years ago now, Konrad."
	msg9_10="That foolish boy killed himself."
	msg9_11="What do you mean, Delfador?"
	msg9_12="I mustered men to fight against the traitor-king, and of course Asheviere, the one behind it all. We were out numbered, perhaps four-to-one. In the heat of battle, that boy, that foolish boy, came charging at me, slashing wildly. I had little choice but to end him."
	msg9_13="So it is true, that you did kill him?"
	msg9_14="He did die in battle, at my hand. It is sad that Konrad's four brothers did not have the opportunity to experience such an 'honorable' death."
	msg9_15="Oh, what happened to them?"
	msg9_16="With all respect my lords, we must make haste. We have to ford the river as a matter of urgency. Look! It seems that the guard towers on the river banks are guarded!"
	msg9_17="Who are those who try to cross the river? We will have to stop them men!"
	msg9_18="Isn't there somewhere else we can cross? Maybe upstream?"
	msg9_19="Winter bears down on us fast. We have only a few days to make the crossing, and the nearest bridge is far upstream. To be trapped south of the river when winter arrives would be suicidal, Asheviere would have us like rats! We must cross here."
	msg9_2="Really? So what happened, Delfador?"
	msg9_20="Come, let us go!"
	msg9_3="The forces of the king were encamped here. The forces of the north were camped on the north side of the river. For three days and three nights the armies faced each other, neither one willing to ford the river. On the fourth day, the northern armies crossed the river, and attacked us."
	msg9_4="Oh, what happened then? Who won?"
	msg9_5="We were winning the battle. We were repelling them."
	msg9_6="Until the king's son, in the heat of battle, until he turned on the king!"
	msg9_7="Oh, and then you....you killed the prince, right Delfador?"
	msg9_8="When I saw the king betrayed and his banner fall, I fled the battle. Be it wisdom or be it cowardice, I fled the battle, seeing us have no hope that day."
	msg9_9="But my mother...the Queen, she always told me that you killed my brother, Sir"
