	choice10="No, I was thinking...I don't really want to kill you. I have what I came to get. So if you promise never to come south of the great river, I will spare your life."
	choice11="With all due respect, Princess, it is once again we who will spare you, Scepter or no Scepter."
	choice12="Such words in the presence of royalty! Do you want me to fry you, Elf?"
	choice13="Friends, peace! Though we are out of the tunnels, we are hardly safe. We are somewhere in the arid and wild north lands, that is all we know. Behold! To the north,  orcs, to the south, dark hordes. We must remain at peace with one another, or else all perish!"
	choice14="I suppose that helping each other for a while longer would be mutually beneficial. But what should we do? How should we defend ourselves?"
	choice15="So, we must choose. To the north past the Orcs, where lie the ancient snow plains of the Elves, or to the south, beyond the armies of the Walking Dead where the dreaded swamps await."
	choice15a="I can tell where we are. That is the river that is known as Longlier to men, called Arkan-thoria in my people's ancient tongue. The home of my people lies to the east."
	choice15b="Then perhaps we should head East along the river, and seek refuge and rest there for a time?"
	choice15c="We should indeed seek refuge there, my lord, but not by going east along the river. Its name means 'The River of Bones'. Great and evil creatures lurk along its banks, its waters are not fit to drink, and it runs over the Cliffs of Thoria. It has been many centuries since any man or elf has passed over the Cliffs and survived. No, Prince, we must choose another way."
	choice15d="But which way, Kalenz?"
	choice15e="We may take two paths which avoid the river. North, through the ancient home of my people, and then east to where they now live. Or we can go south, passing through the Swamps, before turning east, and then north. We would cross the river one time more if we chose that route, but I know a safe place for the crossing."
	choice15f="And will you join us in seeking refuge with the North Elves, Princess?"
	choice15g="If the Elves will promise me refuge and safe passage, then I will go."
	choice15h="That we will, Princess. Even thought you are the daughter of the Queen, our enemy, we shall not harm you on this encounter, for you have helped us."
	choice2="You still want to fight me, do you, Princess?"
	choice3="Did you think I was just playing around? I need to take my inheritance!"
	choice4="It is not so simple! We are back on the surface, but we are hardly safe. We barely know where we are. Look to the north...there are orcs about! Look to the south...there are the hordes of the undead!"
	choice5="Indeed there are. We will have to fight our way out. Are you with us, Princess, or against us?"
	choice6="Perhaps it is in both our best interests for us to remain allies for a little longer...but I do want that Scepter, and someday I will have it!"
	choice7="Then let us devise a battle plan."
	choice8="Well, we got out alive."
	choice9="Yes, we did. Now I suppose you want to use the Scepter against me, Princess?"

	council_1="Greetings, and welcome to our capital. You should feel honored. It has been half a century - a generation in the way your race counts time - since any man has been considered Elf-friend enough to stand here."
	council_10="I had no idea! Thank you, my lady. It is a pleasure to meet you again."
	council_11="Rescued him from my mother? But nineteen years ago Konrad would have been an infant! What is this you are talking about?"
	council_12="Your mother has much blood upon her hands, child. She has had many killed unjustly. When Konrad was an infant, she ordered all the princes put to death, so she could sieze control."
	council_13="She had them murdered? There were others too, not just Konrad? Surely you do not speak the truth! Parandra, what do you say?"
	council_14="Princess, when Delfador the Great speaks of the Queen Mother, Asheviere, ordering the princes of Wesnoth to be put to death, he speaks the truth."
	council_15="And what say you, Elf-king?"
	council_16="I did not see it myself, Princess, but I have heard many reliable reports. Asheviere indeed has the blood of the princes on her hands. She has also allowed Orcs to desecrate the lands, abandoning all respect for the peoples around her."
	council_17a="Well, that is why I must take the Scepter. I will return, and people will accept me as Queen. I will rule justly and fairly. My mother is only Queen Mother. The throne is rightfully mine, and with the Scepter I can prove it."
	council_17b="Princess, there is some good in you, but the throne is not yours to claim. Konrad has the Scepter. He will take the throne."
	council_17d="Well, I have the Scepter! I will return and the people will accept me as Queen! My mother is only Queen Mother. The Throne is rightfully mine, and I will rule from it with justice and fairness. I may even accept you as my advisor and counselor, Delfador"
	council_17e="Though you have the Scepter, Princess, it is rightfully Konrad's. You  have it now only because we helped you get it."
	council_17f="And if I refuse to give it to him?"
	council_17g="If it is necessary, princess, I will ask Konrad to fight you in a duel for it."
	council_17h="Delfador! Li'sar has become our friend. I don't want to fight her! As long as she rules well, what does it matter if she becomes queen?"
	council_17i="You are the rightful heir. You should be king, Konrad."
	council_18="Delfador, you have raised Konrad to be skillful and wise, honorable and just. A warrior who has respect, and appreciates peace. Yet the throne is not the place for him. You know of what I speak, Delfador."
	council_19="But I do not! What is your meaning, Parandra?"
	council_2="We are indeed honored."
	council_20="In time, things will be revealed, fair Princess. For the moment, go forth and claim the throne of Wesnoth."
	council_20a="Parandra, what you say may seem right to some, but as long as you and I speak to no-one of what we know, I see no reason why Konrad would not best have the throne."
	council_20b="In so many things you are right, Delfador, and your wisdom is unmatched in the world of men. But in this, you are mistaken. Li'sar is the heir. She should take the throne. Now that I have met her for myself, I am sure of it."
	council_21="She will claim the throne, and not me? What should I do?"
	council_22="Li'sar should be Queen, but you will go with her. Indeed, I suspect we could not convince you otherwise. I have seen the way you look at her, Konrad. I think that now you would follow her even to the ends of the earth."
	council_23="With all due respect, my lady, she is my cousin! There is nothing between us!"
	council_24="Then if it is as you say, Konrad, perhaps you should stay here with us. It would surely be safer for you. The Elves could show you things that would amaze you, things that no man has seen before."
	council_25="That is a generous offer, my lady, but you are indeed right, I would rather go with Li'sar."
	council_26="And what say you, Uradredia?"
	council_27="Tell me, Li'sar, are you willing to fight your own mother for the throne?"
	council_28="It is for the good of the country. If it is necessary, I will fight her, Elf-king."
	council_29="I feel that this lady speaks the truth. Delfador, although I know that you do not concur, the words of Parandra, daughter of Elandria are wise. Rest here for a time, and then go forth with them."
	council_3="I might also say that it is you who are honored. It has been so long since you have been graced by with the presence of a princess of Wesnoth."
	council_30="And you have been with us for a time, Kalenz son of Kliada, what say you?"
	council_31="Wisdom has been spoken here today, Delfador. We have been with Li'sar in the most trying of times, and risked life and limb with her. Yet we still have both our lives and our limbs. She lacks experience, and has too much of the brashness of youth, but she will make a good Queen in time."
	council_32="So, the Elven Council has spoken. But which path should we take on our journey? The Ford of Abez will not be passible, for surely it will be watched and guarded by many men."
	council_33="There is another way by which you can return to Wesnoth: past the mountains of the dragons and through the dark valley. To the land of the East, from there you can return to Wesnoth and surprise the Dark Queen, catching her off-guard."
	council_34="Mountains of the dragons? That sounds very dangerous! I didn't even think there were such things as dragons!"
	council_35="No dragon has been sighted in those mountains for many years, but they retain their name of old. Still, that path will be dangerous for us. Is there not another route we might take?"
	council_36="All routes are dangerous, though there is some hope along this path. Rest, and then go forth, friends. Fortune has smiled upon you so far, despite great dangers. Perhaps she will continue to do so."
	council_4="Silence, foolish girl! With such arrogance, is it any surprise that the royal family of Wesnoth long ago saw their ancient alliances fall to pieces?"
	council_5="Yes...you are right, sir. It is I who am honored to be here, and I apologize for my discourtesy."
	council_6="Delfador the Great. As wise with his tongue in advice as he is strong with his staff in battle. A rare combination, especially among men."
	council_7="How quickly do the race of men mature! Only nineteen winters have passed since I last laid eyes on you, Konrad, yet you are now a grown man. A brave warrior stands before me!"
	council_8="Forgive me, Elf, but I'm afraid I do not recall meeting you before."

	hasty_7="Don't try to trick me! I know why you have come here! But I will put an end to you and your treason here. Then I will get the Scepter, and return to the daylight again!"
	hasty_8="Surprise! Die, you sun-lovers!"
	hasty_9="Now we are surrounded! Do you still want to fight us, Princess? Surely that would lead to doom for us all!"

	intro_1="In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Garard II, king of Wesnoth, the kingdom was plunged into a bitter war with the Peoples of the North."
	intro_10="Asheviere herself then took command of the army, and led it back to Weldyn. Knowing that the king's young nephews were next in line to the throne, she ordered them all killed, and declared herself Queen of Wesnoth."
	intro_11="Soon after news of Asheviere's orders reached Delfador, he secretly entered the palace and stole away Konrad, the youngest of Garard's nephews, thereby saving him from death."
	intro_12="Fleeing to the forests of the West, Delfador raised the child Konrad under the protection of the Elves, watching sadly as Asheviere's reign of terror over the land began..."
	intro_13="...but one of the Orcs survived long enough to send the news to the queen..."
	intro_14="...and she sent her most able commander."
	intro_2="The Northern host encamped at Galcadar, by the ford of Abez, and the king led his forces to meet them. Splitting his army in two, he led one half while his son, the crown prince Eldred, led the other."
	intro_3="Eldred was a brave and courageous warrior, able to lead his soldiers well. Unfortunately for Garard, his son was also ambitious...and treacherous. In the heat of battle,  Eldred's men turned on the king. And so, Garard was slain in battle that day, along with his brother and all his sons but Eldred."
	intro_4="Garard's queen, Asheviere, looked on with glee, having come to watch the battle from a nearby hill. The rule of her son would surely satisfy her lust for power far better than her husband's had."
	intro_5="In exchange for tribute, the Northern king happily made peace with Eldred, who proclaimed himself king and led his army back to Weldyn."
	intro_6="But Garard's arch-mage, Delfador, had escaped the battle and, riding with haste, reached Weldyn first. He mustered a force of loyalists to fight Eldred and avenge the king's death."
	intro_7="Eldred made war upon Delfador and his forces with his mother's advice ringing in his ears: 'Fight no one great or small except the old mage, whose head should be severed from his shoulders.'"
	intro_8="And Eldred did indeed meet Delfador face-to-face in battle that day. Sword clashed against staff, as the wise old mage fought the brash young warrior."
	intro_9="In the end Delfador's men were defeated and routed, but Asheviere found her son's lifeless body, fixed to the ground by the great mage's staff."

	isledamn_1a="But the voyage did not go as smoothly as had been hoped. A storm blew up and bore down on the ship. Though all hands were on deck working desperately, a sudden gust of wind flung Konrad overboard as he attempted to secure the sails..."
	isledamn_2a="The mermen finally saved Konrad from the sea, but were unable to get him back to the ship. With great effort though, they reached a nearby island..."
	isledamn_3="Whew, I survived. But now where am I? Is this island inhabited?"
	isledamn_4a="We have heard only the worst things about this place, my lord. It is said that the fiends of the undead have come in great numbers and turned the island into an ugly wasteland."
	isledamn_5="Let's hope these rumors are not true! I have none of my men with me! How could I defend myself?"
	isledamn_6="There are still some bands of humans hiding on the island, my lord. If you recruit some of them to help, we might have some hope of holding off the undead hordes!"

	msg10_11="What do you say, Delfador?"
	msg10_12="No! We do not have the time to waste. Let us make for the top of the pass, wary of mountain trolls, and taking care lest we come too close to the water!"
	msg10_13="The Shinsplitters will aid you in your quest. Look, they rise from the villages to the west, the mighty Shinsplitters! To battle!"
	msg10_2="Look, Konrad, before us lies the great road built by the dwarves!"
	msg10_20="Well, we have defeated our foes let us hope the mountain does not defeat us!"
	msg10_21="I wish you all the best on your journey, I must return to my village and take care of my family. Dwarven hospitality will welcome you wherever you go, friends!"
	msg10_22="Let us move onward!"
	msg10_3a="But I can hardly see with all this mist around!"
	msg10_4b="We must be wary...they say a wizard lives in these mountains, and he does not take kindly to visitors. It is he who causes the mists, so that travellers will lose their way and become prey for his creatures."
	msg10_5b="His...creatures? We must keep to the road, men!"
	msg10_6b="He would be a mighty foe, Konrad. It is said when the dwarves built this road, they disturbed the resting place of the ancient mage, and ever since, he and his brother have traveled the mountain, wreacking havoc on the dwarven villages."
	msg10_7b="Let us then go carefully...but quickly, men!"
	msg10_9="Greetings, Travellers. I am Stalrag, chief of the these villages! I warn you, a great wizard and his trolls are in the mountains and will surely attack. I will summon my tribesmen to aid you!"
	msg10a_20="Aaargh! I am done for! Fight on without me, Brethren!"
	msg11_1="The doors are closed and barred from the inside!"
	msg11_10="The legend was true! There are always tentacled creatures hiding in the lakes near the Dwarven Kingdoms"
	msg11_11="At last, this is the entrance to the Dwarven Kingdoms."
	msg11_12="All can I see are ruins and poor villages."
	msg11_13="The poor villagers that once lived here and traded with the dwarves are now held in slavery by the orcs."
	msg11_14="Slaves to the evil orcs? We must liberate them!"
	msg11_15="That would not be a wise choice, for our mission is to retreive the Scepter of Fire. If we tarry in this place, hordes of orcs will surround us."
	msg11_16="Konrad, heed the words of Defaldor. We shall return to wrest the grip of the orcs from these lands."
	msg11_17="This does not please me, but I will listen to your advice."
	msg11_17a="My uncle used to smuggle...err...I mean...trade food for the Dwarves. He could get grain carts in under the very noses of those ugly orcs."
	msg11_17b="He must be hiding in one of those villages."
	msg11_17c="Haw! My niece's friends are mine friends too"
	msg11_2b="We can't get in! What should we do now?"
	msg11_3="It is said that the orcs used an old mine tunnel to surprise the dwarves. It must be that one in the north-east."
	msg11_4="Then we must make it to that tunnel!"
	msg11_5a="There is no time for idle chatter or delay of any kind. Onward!"
	msg11_5b="I am hesitant to enter. It will be so difficult in the darkness!"
	msg11_5c="Indeed we must not delay. I remember now, the mines in the North-East are the best way to enter!"
	msg11_5d="But Konrad's party was not alone in entering the mines..."
	msg11_6="The defense of the dwarves must have been strong. Look at those ruined towers!"
	msg11_7="The battle outside was fierce, and lasted a full half-year. But the battles inside the tunnels were worse."
	msg11_9="A monster was hiding in that lake!"
	msg11_9a="Ruarrrrr!!!"
	msg12_1="It's so dark in here I can hardly see!"
	msg12_10="You go too far! I am Kalenz, a mighty Elvish lord! How dare such as you, snivelling in his tunnel, call me a coward?"
	msg12_11="Peace, friends! Peace! The evil Orcs roam the lands above us, we must not fight among ourselves."
	msg12_12="Very well! Explain your presence here then, human. Who are you? Why have you risked life and limb to come to Knalga, home of the Dwarves?"
	msg12_13="Well, we...we..."
	msg12_14="We have come so that an heir may claim his inheritance, that a king may claim his throne. We seek the Scepter of Fire."
	msg12_15="The Scepter of Fire? Are you out of your minds? Surely you speak in jest!"
	msg12_16="We jest not, friend. We seek the Scepter of Fire. We seek the help of the Dwarves in finding it. But know that we will find it, whether you help us or not."
	msg12_17="Your speech is like that of a fool. No-one even knows if the Scepter of Fire exists. And who is this heir, this king that you speak of?"
	msg12_18="I am, sir."
	msg12_19="You? Ha ha! This boy that stands before me is the king of Wesnoth? Ha ha! I haven't had such a laugh in a long time. And who are you, old man?"
	msg12_2="It is dark indeed. We shall have to light torches, and tread slowly and carefully. Hopefully there are still Dwarves down here who can aid us!"
	msg12_20="I am Delfador, Delfador the Great, Arch Mage to King Garard, and Protector of his heir."
	msg12_21="You...you are Delfador? I saw Delfador when I was but a young Dwarf, and I will tell you, old man, you are not Delfador. Men! Take these liars out of my sight. Delfador perished many years ago."
	msg12_22="I am Delfador the Great! Any who dare oppose me shall perish!"
	msg12_23="You...you really are Delfador! But we had news that you were dead, years ago!"
	msg12_24="They thought I was dead. They hoped I was dead. Yet still I live."
	msg12_25="And you really think that you can find the Scepter of Fire?"
	msg12_26="Yes, I do. If you help us, friend, all the treasures of Knalga that we find are yours. We want only the Scepter. It will be dangerous. Make no mistake about that: Dwarves will be killed, perhaps many Dwarves. But surely it is better than hiding from the Orcs like worms."
	msg12_27="You are right, friend. I will put my best men at your disposal. We know not where the Scepter is though. Legend says it is hidden in the northern tunnels."
	msg12_28="Then to the northern tunnels we shall go!"
	msg12_29="Hmm...there seems to be a secret passage behind these rocks!"
	msg12_3="Indeed. We Elves are not well skilled in these dark pits."
	msg12_30="There is a great fortune in this chest of treasure! I can count two hundred pieces of gold!"
	msg12_5="Who are these that approach? Surface-dwellers! On your guard, men!"
	msg12_6="We come in peace, friends. We come in peace!"
	msg12_7="Oh, do you? I see that you are accompanied by Elves. Can we Dwarves not live in peace without the treacherous Elves coming to bother us?"
	msg12_8="Why such harsh words, Dwarf? Elves have never done you any harm."
	msg12_9="'Never done us any harm?' Why I was there myself, when the Elves did not come to honor our alliance. Many Dwarves were slaughtered, and you cowardly Elves did nothing to help!"
	msg13_1="These are some of the main Dwarvish caverns."
	msg13_10="The earth shakes."
	msg13_2="Underground roads once led to the differents parts of the complex, but now everything lies in ruins."
	msg13_3="The sign says 'Guest quarters'."
	msg13_4="My uncle's family drowned after the orcs flooded that cavern..."
	msg13_5="These passages seem to have been used recently."
	msg13_6="There is a big cave-in south of here."
	msg13_7="RUMBLE! RUMBLE! RUMBLE!"
	msg13_8="The rocks are moving!"
	msg13_9a="Who goes there? Friend or foe?"
	msg13_9b="We are desperately trying to rid these tunnels of the foul Orcs! Please help us in our quest."
	msg13_9c="Ah, a foul Orc! Let us rid these tunnels of its kind!"
	msg13_9d="I did not know that the undead were in these pits!"
	msg13_9e="Who is this foul enemy that we fight?"
	msg13_9f="I am Lionel. I am the Lost General. I will avenge myself upon you all!"
	msg13_9g="Avenge? What have we done to you that you must avenge?"
	msg13_9h="Lionel? A General? I remember that name..."
	msg13_9i="Remember me, do you? Aye. I was the king's finest general, sent down to these pits to retrieve the Scepter. But the Orcs trapped me and my men in this cavern, to starve to death. The Dwarves were no help, leaving me to die. Now I will get revenge on you all!"
	msg13_die1="Argh! I am vanquished! But at least by worthy foes, instead of those foul Orcs."
	msg13_die2="Rest in peace, Lionel. The poor, lost general."
	msg13_die3="I am destroyed, but my mission must be completed. Though you are foes, you are at least worthy ones, so I will tell you that the Scepter is further north from here, deep in the caverns. May you have better fortune in your quest than I did!"
	msg1_1="Fourteen years into her rule, Asheviere turned her attention to the Elves, whom she despised. Orcish mercenaries were hired and dispatched to bring about their ruin."
	msg1_10="Let them come. We will fight them with all we have!"
	msg1_11="Be careful, Konrad! Guard him well, Delfador!"
	msg1_12="And so it has begun!"
	msg1_13="OK, we have made it this far! But where do we go next?"
	msg1_14="We must travel north, and try to make it to the Isle of Anduin. Hopefully we will find refuge there."
	msg1_15="Of course you are right, Delfador. But what will become of the Elves here?"
	msg1_16="The Elves will fight. They may even prevail. But I fear things do not bode well for them. Let us not speak of it now. Onward!"
	msg1_17="Good luck, Konrad! Don't worry about us, we will fight as best we can!"
	msg1_18="I...I don't think I can make it anymore"
	msg1_19="Prince...you must keep fighting! Nooooooo!"
	msg1_2="Master Delfador! Look, there are Orcs coming from all directions! What shall we do?"
	msg1_20="It is over, I am doomed..."
	msg1_21="I have...have failed in my duty to protect the prince! I am defeated."
	msg1_22="Don't die, Delfador! Please, you have to stay alive!"
	msg1_23="Ugh"
	msg1_24="Oh, no! We have run out of time, they have arrived with reinforcements..."
	msg1_25="Die, Villain, die!"
	msg1_26="Only the foolish oppose me!"
	msg1_27="I am Galdrad. You will have to fight me to get any further!"
	msg1_28="Only a fool would dare to attack me!"
	msg1_28a="I am Delfador the Great. Prepare to die!"
	msg1_29="Let me through, you rogue!"
	msg1_3="There are too many to fight, far too many. We must escape!"
	msg1_30="They are destroying our home!"
	msg1_31="There can be no looking back. We must go quickly!"
	msg1_4="But to where? This is the only home we have! What about the Elves?"
	msg1_5="We will fight them, but you must escape, Konrad. It is imperative that you escape!"
	msg1_6="We will go north. Perhaps we can reach the Isle of Anduin. If we can make it there, surely we will be safe. Konrad, we must recruit some Elves to help us, and then you must make it to the sign post in the north-west. I will protect you!"
	msg1_7="Very well, let us hurry!"
	msg1_8="Attack the Elves, my grunts, and take their villages. Let us claim this land for the Queen!"
	msg1_9="Ha ha! We will rip the filthy Elves to pieces!"
	msg1_9hard="Remember, it is rumored that the filthy mage and one that he protects are in these parts. They are the ones we want!"
	msg1b_12="We should embark now."
	msg1b_13="Safe voyage to you, friends. Rest assured that we will never surrender to the forces of the Dark Queen."
	msg1b_14="Without his help, we will be unable to use the ships. There is no hope..."
	msg1b_1a="We should be able to board a ship at Blackwater Port, but it seems the Orcs are heading there too. Rebels who hate Asheviere and are loyal to the memory of the king desperately hold the port, as it is one of the only places where they can ship supplies and weapons."
	msg1b_2="Defaldor, some Orcs are following us! We must make haste!"
	msg1b_3a="Delfador, my old friend! We had heard of your coming, and of the attacks on the Elves. It is good to see you again, although I would prefer it were not in such sad times."
	msg1b_3b="Konrad, this is Kaylan, one of the mightiest of the horse lords, and one of the few who is willing to oppose the dark crown. Rumor has it that his lance has slain fifty men and a hundred orcs."
	msg1b_3c="It seems the orcs have come here too, to try to wrest this port from our hands. Our defenses are still weak, but reinforcements will arrive soon!"
	msg1b_4="We will help you fight them off until the reinforcements arrive."
	msg1b_5c="Hopefully with your help we can ward them off. But you must not tarry here long, for your survival is even more important to our cause than the strength of the port. A ship is due here in two days, surely it will be able to take you to safety."
	msg1b_5d="And the ship will take us to Anduin?"
	msg1b_5e="Yes, we will sail to the Isle of Anduin, my home Konrad, and the home of many mages."
	msg1b_5f="I will send one of my horsemen to serveunder you. I offer you my support Konrad, and the support of my men - from now on you will be able to recruit horsemen."
	msg1b_5g_a="Thank you, sir. But how shall I best use these horsemen? How do they differ from Elves?"
	msg1b_5h="Elves are a powerful race, Konrad, more powerful than my own people usually acknowledge. But horsemen are powerful in a different way. They have no long range attack, but can charge into combat, inflicting double normal damage, though taking double damage in return. They are also lawful, meaning they are better at day, and worse at night. Horsemen are unmatched on open land, though Elves will serve you better in rugged terrain."
	msg1b_5i="Recruit troops wisely, Konrad, and remember that you can recall experienced units from past battles to help you fight again."
	msg1b_6a="Reinforcements have arrived! Forward men! I expect each of you to bring me back the head of an orc!"
	msg1b_7a="So many foul humans riding on horses! There is no way we can defeat them. Quick, we must make our escape!"
	msg1b_8a="Thank you for the help, friends. The ship should arrive soon, it will take you to Anduin."
	msg2_1="And so the party landed on the Isle of Anduin."
	msg2_2="So this is Anduin. It looks a little...desolate"
	msg2_3a="I fear so, Konrad. It seems that the Orcs have come even here. Here to the place where I was born, where I was trained."
	msg2_4="Who is that? Oh, a party of elves has landed. We shall drive them back into the sea!"
	msg2_5="I did not think the Orcs would have come here. This island used to be so beautiful. We must recapture it! To arms!"
	msg2_6a="Delfador, my old master! You have saved the island from the Orcs!"
	msg2_6b="My apprentice. How did the island fall to such as these?"
	msg2_6c="You have not heard, master Delfador? Asheviere is trying to control the entire western coast. She hired many Orcs and sent them here. The Orcs were holding me here until a ship arrived to take me to Weldyn to stand trial for treason for training mages!"
	msg2_6d="We have come from fighting her forces at Blackwater. Where else has she attacked?"
	msg2_6e="She has taken control of the Bay of Pearls, long held by the mermen, and has enslaved the mermen, making them dive for pearls for her. With the pearls she grows richer every day. There are even rumors that she may break the ancient treaty and attack Elensefar!"
	msg2_6f="Can't we strike back at her? How many forces does she have at the Bay of Pearls? Can we take it back from her?"
	msg2_6g="Go there, we must. Let us rest here a little, and then we shall set sail for the Bay. Hopefully we will be able to defeat her forces there!"
	msg2_mage_1="I found someone hiding in the village!"
	msg2_mage_2="My lords, I have been hiding in the village from the orcs, like many of the other mages here. Perhaps we can work together to recapture the island!"
	msg2_mage_3="Certainly, let us join together to fight the evil ones"
	msg2_mage_4="You can now recruit mages"
	msg3_1="So this is the Bay of Pearls. It looks like they have those mermen working hard!"
	msg3_10="But...but...how can this be happening to me?"
	msg3_11="Who was that idiot?"
	msg3_12="Free at last! Now death to the Orcs!"
	msg3_13="Now that we are free, together we can defeat our oppressors!"
	msg3_13a="Death to the orcs! Come, let us all fight them, men!"
	msg3_14="Freedom! Now where are those Orcs? Let me at 'em!"
	msg3_16="At last, we have freed the mermen. Go back to the ocean and live in peace."
	msg3_17="My lord! You may need the help of some of us who have skill in the sea in future. We would like to offer you help, and come with you."
	msg3_18="Now where is Delfador? I hope he's safe!"
	msg3_19="I am perfectly safe, friend!"
	msg3_2="Indeed it does. It also looks like they have many, many troops. I should go around the bay and distract some of them. You and the rest rescue the mermen!"
	msg3_20="There you are! I am so glad you are all right! Now we may have a little rest."
	msg3_21="I am afraid there is no time for rest, Konrad. Asheviere has now laid siege to Elensefar, breaking the century-old treaty between Wesnoth and the Elense city-state. If the city falls, there is no telling how many other lands she may swallow up!"
	msg3_22="Oh no! What shall we do?"
	msg3_23="You must lead our men to the city, and help defend it. Or recapture it if it falls before you arrive."
	msg3_24="I must do that? But what about you, Delfador? You're coming with me, right?"
	msg3_25="I am afraid not, Konrad. I have come across some important documents, and must make haste with them to the Elven Council. It seems that the time to stop Asheviere is shorter than I had thought."
	msg3_26="But Delfador! I can't do it on my own!"
	msg3_27="On your own? My lord! We, your loyal soldiers, will support you!"
	msg3_28="You will prevail. I have faith in you. Head north. Elensefar is but three days travel if you make haste."
	msg3_29a="Very well. But how do I get there?"
	msg3_3="Very well. Be careful!"
	msg3_30_farewell="Safe journey to you, Konrad. Until we meet again!"
	msg3_30_farewella="Safe voyage to you then, Konrad. May the weather be fair."
	msg3_30_optiona="Ships? Ugh! I have been sea sick for the last time. We shall walk!"
	msg3_30_optionb="Going by ship we may at least get a little rest for ourselves. By sea it is!"
	msg3_30a="It is north-west of here, a few leagues inland. There are two ways to go, by ship or on foot. Each has its own dangers. You must choose between them."
	msg3_31="Have you not been able to defeat our foes in all these days? They have summoned reinforcements. Surely now our doom is upon us!"
	msg3_32="Konrad! We cannot spend any more time here. Though it would be good to defeat the Orcs and free more of their prisoners, more urgent business calls us!"
	msg3_33="Delfador, thank goodness you have survived! This has been a tough battle, but why can we not finish it? Why must we leave?"
	msg3_34="I bear ill tidings. Asheviere has now laid siege to Elensefar, breaking the century-old treaty between Wesnoth and the Elense city-state. If the city falls, there is no telling how many other lands she may swallow up!"
	msg3_35="I must do this? But you are coming with me, aren't you, Delfador?"
	msg3_36="I am afraid not, Konrad. I have found some important documents that need seeing to. I must ride at once to make council with the Elves. I will meet you in Elensefar, after you have secured it."
	msg3_37="I fear I will struggle to do this on my own...but what must be must be. How do I get to Elensefar?"
	msg3_38="Since you have broken the Orc's hegemony over the seas, going by ship would be safest. Sail along the coast, and you can land mere miles from Elensefar. Make haste!"
	msg3_39="With the Orcs controlling the seas, going by ship would not be safe. Travel by land, Elensefar is only six days' march up the coast. Make haste!"
	msg3_4="But boss, why are we only using bats and nagas?"
	msg3_5="Because we need to control the seas and the merman folk, and nagas and bats are best for doing that!"
	msg3_6="But orcs are the most powerful race in all of..."
	msg3_7="Shut up, worm! I'm the boss!"
	msg3_8="Ha ha ha! Now orcs will rule over land and sea!"
	msg3_9="(Sigh) Will someone kill this idiot for me, please?"
	msg4_1="But the road to Elensefar was a treacherous one. Konrad and his men were set upon by the fiends of the undead."
	msg4_10_a="Surprise! Searching for Mages, and all I get is these foul humans!"
	msg4_11="The temple seems to be empty."
	msg4_12b="Victory is ours! Let us just hope that this delay will not hamper our quest to save Elensefar. We must move onward with haste!"
	msg4_2="My lord! In yonder ruins there seems to be some movement!"
	msg4_3="It looks like there are the undead there! Prepare for battle men!"
	msg4_4="To arms!"
	msg4_5="Ahh, a party of Elves approaches. Soon we shall have Elven zombies serving us!"
	msg4_6_a="There are some ancient temples to the south-west, I wonder what might be inside them!"
	msg4_7="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
	msg4_8="I was hiding in this holy place, planning how to defeat the evil undeads. Now with your help, I can destroy them."
	msg4_9="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
	msg4_moredie="Fight on against the undead without me, friends!"
	msg5_1="The party arrived at Elensefar at last, but found that the city had already fallen to the evil Orcs."
	msg5_10="Thieves, hmmm? Who says we can trust such as you?"
	msg5_11="We would understand if you don't trust us, of course, but it is in our mutual interest to rid the city of the Orcs!"
	msg5_12a="Hmm...I have to consider this..."
	msg5_13a="We will serve you well, for we respect the help you are providing to our city. You shall find that there is honor, even among thieves."
	msg5_14a="Very well, we shall be gone then. You shall have to recapture the city without our help!"
	msg5_14b="Finally, we have retaken the city! Let us rest here, friends."
	msg5_14c="Victory! The thieves of Elensefar will be in your service, my lord"
	msg5_15b="The party rested for three days, after which an old friend returned."
	msg5_16="Greetings, friends. I see that you have rescued the city! I knew that you could do it."
	msg5_17="Delfador! So good to see you! Where have you been?"
	msg5_18="I have been meeting with the Great Elven Council. This is Kalenz, a lord of the Northern Elves who came to the Council to offer us the support of the North Elves."
	msg5_19="Greetings, friend."
	msg5_2="My lord! It seems the city has already fallen!"
	msg5_20="Delfador, we have captured this city, but surely Asheviere's men will come and attack us! What should we do?"
	msg5_21="The Council has met and decided: we must capture the Scepter of Fire."
	msg5_22="The Scepter of Fire? What's that?"
	msg5_23="During the reign of Garard I, your uncle's father, the dwarves of Knalga agreed to make the king a magnificent scepter. It took their finest smiths years to make it. But soon after it was completed, Orcs invaded the tunnels of Knalga. Now Knalga is in chaos, and, though some Dwarves still live in parts of it, at constant war with the Orcs, the Scepter was lost somewhere in the great caverns."
	msg5_24="But what has this to do with me?"
	msg5_25="When Garard II, your uncle, was deciding upon a successor, he issued an edict that whichever member of the royal family could retrieve the Scepter of Fire would rule the land."
	msg5_26="Oh, and you want me to get this scepter?"
	msg5_26a="We will help you get it, my lord."
	msg5_27="Time is short. We think that Asheviere is also searching for the Scepter, to help seal her place as ruler. But if you get the Scepter first, the people will support you as the king."
	msg5_28="Me? King?"
	msg5_29="Yes, Konrad. I believe you will be king one day. Now let us make haste!"
	msg5_3="This is terrible news! We must retake the city!"
	msg5_4="There are so many of them. This will not be easy! And look to the south! It seems that the undead are allied with the Orcs!"
	msg5_5="Here come the Elves! With our newly forged alliance with the Orcs, we will crush them with ease!"
	msg5_6="We must take the city, and destroy the evil undead before reinforcements arrive!"
	msg5_7="In the night, three dark figures creep out of the forest."
	msg5_8="Halt! Who goes there, friend or foe?"
	msg5_9="Greetings, friend. We are from the Elensefar Thieves Guild. We would like to help you against the Orcs!"
	msg6_1="On the road to Knalga, the party was opposed by the forces of Asheviere."
	msg6_2="The Queen has sent me to stop you, you imposter!"
	msg6_27="I surrender! Don't hurt me, Imposter."
	msg6_28="I said before I'm not an imposter, but if you yield, I will spare your life."
	msg6_29="Let me go!"
	msg6_3="That's the princess, Li'sar. The daughter of the Queen, and her successor!"
	msg6_30="Think about the story of the old king. Ask somebody who knew of him."
	msg6_31="The old king? I have heard about that, but I know it is not true. My mother told me."
	msg6_32="Your mother has lied to you, child. Now I suggest you reconsider, and either join us, or flee an exile. There will be a great battle soon, and if you are on the wrong side of it, we may not have the opportunity to spare your life a second time."
	msg6_33="I am not a child, and I do not want to talk about it! You said you would spare me, so be on your way. The northern road should be safe for you."
	msg6_34="Good day then, Princess. Come, men, to the northern road!"
	msg6_35="(He he, little do they know just how many undead have wandered the northern road of late. Surely they are doomed!)"
	msg6_4="I'm no imposter. It seems that your mother has lied to you."
	msg6_4b="This is treason! Your lies will perish with you!"
	msg6_5="There is no use in reasoning. She will understand only one thing. To arms!"
	msg6_6="This is taking too much time, I had best call some reinforcements!"
	msg6_7="Maybe I was not using enough forces..."
	msg7_1="My lord! This road does not seem as safe as we had hoped. Look around us at the hills - there are undead about!"
	msg7_10a="The sun rises in the east. Surely the undead do not have the power to continue their onslaught through another day!"
	msg7_10b="Indeed not! I feel we have survived this battle."
	msg7_10c="Whew! That was a difficult battle, but they are retreating at last!"
	msg7_11="Yes! We have fought them off!"
	msg7_12a="This place makes me feel uneasy, even with the undead retreating. Where may we go now?"
	msg7_12b="Thank you for returning to help us, Moremirmu."
	msg7_12c_a="It greatly saddens me that Moremirmu was slain on the field, after he helped us."
	msg7_13a="The land of Wesnoth is not safe for us. The Queen's forces reach every corner. We must make haste to the north lands, across the great river. Let us go quickly!"
	msg7_13b="It is both my duty and pleasure, my lord! We were dining with some royal guards of the princess, taking a rest from our pilgrimage, when they spoke of how you were tricked into traveling these dangerous lands. We could do nothing but help you!"
	msg7_13c="May he rest peacefully!"
	msg7_14a="Indeed! Let us go from here!"
	msg7_14b="So, she tricked us into coming this way! Where may we go now? Which way will be safe for us?"
	msg7_14c="He died fighting for you, Prince, just as any of us would be willing to die for you."
	msg7_15b="You must get out of the clutches of that vile Queen, my lord. If you take a course bearing north-east, on past the mountain of gryphons, you will be able to ford the great river at Abez. Make haste though, for you will not be able to ford the river in winter!"
	msg7_16b="Thank you for your counsel, good friend! May our paths meet again in happier times!"
	msg7_2="Who are these who approach? Let us kill them all!"
	msg7_3="To arms, men! The undead hordes approach!"
	msg7_3_a="Let us never surrender to these foul beasts of the pit! We fight until victory, or until every one of us is slain!"
	msg7_4="There are just so many! What shall we do?"
	msg7_5="Let us hold them off as long as we can!"
	msg7_6b="I have come once again to aid you, friends!"
	msg7_7b="White mages? Come to help us? But what are they doing here?"
	msg7_8b_a="That is Moremirmu! He helped us fight the undead in the Isles of the Damned, let us hope he can help us once more!"
	msg8_1a="What is this place? That is one big mountain!"
	msg8_2b="That is the fabled Gryphon Mountain."
	msg8_3c="Gryphon Mountain! Maybe we could steal some eggs from the gryphons and train the young to be flying mounts. Would that work, Delfador?"
	msg8_4b="We can try to do that, but we must be careful. To disturb the gryphons could prove dangerous...and yet such mounts could help us greatly later. Whatever we do, we must pass by this place."
	msg8_5b="Well, let's start climbing the mountain!"
	msg8_5c="It appears that we are not the only ones are interested in this mountain. Once again the Queen opposes us!"
	msg8_5d="Quickly, men! Onward!"
	msg8_6="We have defeated them! Now what do we do?"
	msg8_7="We must continue north. It is too late to return to the safety of Elensefar or Anduin before winter falls. We must therefore cross the great river and continue toward the land of the Dwarves. Hurry, let us go!"
	msg8_8="With these gryphon eggs we should be able to breed gryphons that will serve us. Then we can hire gryphon riders!"
	msg8_8b="It is a shame we could not get those Gryphon eggs - they would surely have given us an advantage sometime. Still, we must continue."
	msg8_9b="Let us continue onward!"
	msg9_1="This is the Ford of Abez. When we ford this river, we will be leaving Wesnoth, and entering the lands of the North. The Dwarves once ruled these lands, but they are now filled only with chaos. This is where your father and uncle were betrayed, almost nineteen years ago now, Konrad."
	msg9_10="That foolish boy killed himself."
	msg9_11="What do you mean?"
	msg9_12="I mustered men to fight against the traitor-king, and of course Asheviere too, for she was behind it all. We were out numbered, perhaps four to one. In the heat of battle, that boy, fool that he was, came charging at me, slashing wildly. I had little choice but to end his life."
	msg9_13b="So it is true, you did kill him?"
	msg9_14b="He did die in battle at my hand. It is sad that your brothers did not have the opportunity to experience such an honorable death, Konrad."
	msg9_16="With all respect, my lords, we must make haste. We have to ford the river immediately. And, look! It seems that the guard-towers on the river banks are manned!"
	msg9_17="Look! Some of the southerners, men of Wesnoth, are trying to cross into our lands! We will slaughter them by the river's edge!"
	msg9_18="Isn't there somewhere else we can cross? Maybe upstream?"
	msg9_19="Winter quickly bears down upon us. We have only a few days to make the crossing, and the nearest bridge is far upstream. To be trapped south of the river when winter arrives would be suicide. Asheviere would have us trapped like rats! Look to the west! Asheviere has a border fort, and it seems to be full of soldiers! We must cross here, and quickly!"
	msg9_19b="There they are! So it is true, they foiled the undead. Now they are trying to leave Wesnoth. We can't let them cross the river. After them, men!"
	msg9_2="Really? So what happened, Delfador?"
	msg9_20a="Not her again! Quickly! We must hurry!"
	msg9_3="The forces of the king were encamped here, and the forces of the north were on the north side of the river. For three days and three nights the armies faced each other, neither willing to ford the river. On the fourth day, the northern armies crossed and attacked us."
	msg9_4b="And then...we were defeated?"
	msg9_5="We were winning the battle. We were repelling them..."
	msg9_6="And then the king's son, in the heat of battle, turned upon the king!"
	msg9_7b="But you avenged the murder. You killed the prince. Right, Delfador?"
	msg9_8="When I saw the king betrayed and his banner fallen, I fled the battle. I know not now whether it was wisdom or cowardice, but I did flee, seeing no further hope on that day."
	msg9_9b="Oh, but the Elves always told me that you killed the prince, Delfador, even though you never talked about it."
	msg9_a1="Ruaarrrrrrrr!"
	msg9_a2="What is that?"
	msg9_a4="Creatures of the deep are upon us! This may be very dangerous. Be quick! We must get to the other side with all haste!"
	msg9_a5="If we are to have any hope of penetrating into Knalga, we must continue north to seek help from the northern Dwarves."
	msg9_a6="I cannot believe it. They have made it away! We must make chase. After them, men! Let us cross the river too! We will meet again, foul imposter."
	msg9_a7="Do you think she's really going to chase us, Delfador?"
	msg9_a8="It surely looks like she will try, but the sea creatures will make it difficult for her. We must continue onward. If she makes it across before winter, then so be it!"
	msg_delfador_die="No! This is the end! We have been defeated!"
	msg_doors_lisar="Whew! We make our way through the dangerous fog of the mountains, and now there is all this chaos before us! Come on, men! We must make it to the mines, which lie ahead of us!"
	msg_get_gold_swamp="You loot 100 pieces of gold from the corpse!"
	msg_kalenz_die="Argh! I am finished!"
	msg_konrad_die="We are vanquished, for I have been defeated!"
	msg_lisar_die="I can't believe it should end like this!"
	msg_nw_8="More snow is falling. We must finish this battle quickly. Onward men!"
	msg_orc10_10="Here we are, my friends.  Earl Lanbec'h and his kind is on our tails, we must hurry up."
	msg_orc10_20="Hurry up!  The southern bridge is going to explode! Retreat! "
	msg_orc10_30="Without Inarix to lead his saurians, there is no hope."
	msg_orc10_31="We've had too much casualties to be able to resist to humans, we have no choice but surrender."
	msg_orc1_1="Look, companions!  Those orcs don't imagine they are living their last day.  Let's slay all of them and give this land back to our people!"
	msg_orc1_10="Argh!  I die!  But other humans will go and slay you, filthy orcs!"
	msg_orc1_11="Hurrah!  Victory!"
	msg_orc1_12="We are victorious this time, but humans are organizing themselves in a huge army.  We have just defeated a vanguard, they are coming massively."
	msg_orc1_13="What should be do, chief?"
	msg_orc1_14="We must lead my people to a safe place and ask for assistance from the Great Council.  Some of them live in Barag Gor in the lands of the free tribes.  We must leave, now!"
	msg_orc1_15="But the free tribes are beyond the Mountains of Haag.  These moutains are infested of dwarves and wild trolls."
	msg_orc1_16="We have no choice, we shall pass.  The trolls have been our allies in the past--maybe they can help us.  Hurry up, we must leave now."
	msg_orc1_2="We are attacked by these humans!  Hurry up, we must defend our fathers' land!"
	msg_orc1_3="The battle begun."
	msg_orc2_1="We have nearly crossed the mountains.  I feel the lands of the free tribes are near now.  But beware, there are dwarves and wild trolls around.  Hurry up!  I can see the sign post that indicates their land."
	msg_orc2_10="Argh!  I'm done.  My people is dommed!"
	msg_orc2_11="Father!  Oh no!"
	msg_orc2_12="Filthy dwarves!  Now I'm to kill you to the last!"
	msg_orc2_13="Oh no, I'm defeated."
	msg_orc2_14="My son!  I should have never brought him to this fight.  Now we are to return to our caverns, and we will never go back."
	msg_orc2_15="Our troll friends are over.  Without them there is no hope."
	msg_orc2_16="Argh!  I die!"
	msg_orc2_2="What are these orcs doing here?  They should be too tired to live."
	msg_orc2_20="We've succeeded!  We've passed through the Mountains of Haag!  Look at these green hills!  The land of the free tribes is near now.  I can see the walls of Barag-Gor in the distance."
	msg_orc2_21="Blemaker, many thanks for your help in this fight.  Would you like to join us in our journey with your son?  Your help would be very appreciated!"
	msg_orc2_22="Father, I'd like to join them.  Would you mind it?"
	msg_orc2_23="My son, you're old enough to discover the world.  Me, I have to stay here.  But take care, there are plenty of creatures that seek our end, like elves or humans.  They are as clever as merciless."
	msg_orc2_24="Thanks, father.  Don't worry, I'll take care of myself."
	msg_orc2_25="We've succeeded!  We've passed through the Mountains of Haag!  Look at these green hills!  The land of the free tribes is near now.  I can see the walls of Barag-Gor in the distance."
	msg_orc2_26="Grüü, many thanks for your help in this fight.  I'm sorry for your father.  Would you like to join us in our journey?  Your help would be very appreciated!"
	msg_orc2_27="My father would have come to help you.  I would insult his memory not to help you.  I come!"
	msg_orc2_3="I've never pushed so far, we are crossing the border of the Black Eye lands."
	msg_orc2_4="Look!  Dwarves are fighting against orcs!"
	msg_orc2_5="Father, we should help them.  Orcs are our allies."
	msg_orc2_6="I don't know if we should do that.  Orcs have been our allies in the past, but they have always treated us as fools."
	msg_orc2_7="But Father, we don't know what they are seeking there, maybe this is a good occasion to get rid of these dwarves."
	msg_orc2_8="You are right, my son.  We will help our orcish friends.  But take care of you ... I would be desperate if something would happen to you."
	msg_orc3_1="Here is Barag Gor."
	msg_orc3_10="You are right, we have to go to a safer place.  You have helped us.  Would you help us again and escort us to the Harbour of Tirigaz?"
	msg_orc3_11="Yes, I need to ask for assistance from whole council.  I'm with you."
	msg_orc3_12="Excellent.  This is a dangerous journey, as we have to take a road near the elvish forest.  This is the road near that yellow farm."
	msg_orc3_13="They are retreating at last!"
	msg_orc3_14="Yes, but I can see that more are pouring from the forest.  We are not in safety."
	msg_orc3_15="You are right, we have to leave to a safer place.  You have helped us.  Would you help us again and escort us to the Harbour of Tirigaz?"
	msg_orc3_16="Yes, I need to ask for assistance to the whole council.  I'm with you."
	msg_orc3_17="Excellent.  This is a dangerous journey, as we have to take a road near the elvish forest.  This is the road near this yellow farm."
	msg_orc3_19="We've made it!  Our journey is still long.  Hurry up, my people!"
	msg_orc3_2="Oh no!  They are besieged by elves.  We must help our brothers to get rid of this mob.  But these filthy elves are so numerous."
	msg_orc3_20="They are destroying our castle!  To my rescue my merry Elves!"
	msg_orc3_21="At your service, Etheliel.  Let push these evil creatures back to their quag!"
	msg_orc3_3="I have a subtle plan, chief."
	msg_orc3_4="Which plan?"
	msg_orc3_5="We go and we kill all of them.  What do you think?"
	msg_orc3_6="..."
	msg_orc3_7="Then, Kapou'e launched his desperate attack to stop the siege of Barag Gor."
	msg_orc3_7_1="Freedom!  Many thanks, Son of The Black Eye.  I'm Jetto, master of assassins, now you can count on the assassins guild to help you in your quest!"
	msg_orc3_8="They are retreating at last!"
	msg_orc3_9="We're not out of the woods yet.  I can see that more are pouring from the forest.  We are not in safety."
	msg_orc4_1="Ahhh, I'm so tired.  It was a good idea to halt in such a quiet place."
	msg_orc4_10="The day is coming, these night creatures will soon return to the pit."
	msg_orc4_11="Grüü, are you forgeting we are ALSO night creatures?"
	msg_orc4_12="Err... well..."
	msg_orc4_2="It is too quiet.  Just plain boring."
	msg_orc4_3="Shut up, I just heard something."
	msg_orc4_4="You're right.  I can see something is moving in these hills.  Looks like there are undead there."
	msg_orc4_5="Excellent!  It is time for exercise!"
	msg_orc4_6="Hmmm, what neat bottle!  What is it?"
	msg_orc4_7="It is written H.O.L.Y W.A.T.E.R"
	msg_orc4_8="I'm thirsty ... *gulp* *gulp*"
	msg_orc4_9="Ahhh, that was yummy!"
	msg_orc5_1="So here is Tirigaz."
	msg_orc5_10="I love this strategy, chief!"
	msg_orc5_12="Pillage!  Let's plunder these orcs!"
	msg_orc5_2="Looks like they are to be facing attack from pirates of the High Sea.  We should help them."
	msg_orc5_22="Aaaargh!  I die!"
	msg_orc5_23="Finally you paid for all of what you did to my Orc brothers!"
	msg_orc5_24="We're back! We have bad news, the humans are regrouping on our tails, we must leave."
	msg_orc5_25="But where is the rest of the council?  We haven't made such a long journey to flee!"
	msg_orc5_26="We had news from them, all of them fled to the East, near the Mourned Hills.  I think we should go for them as soon as possible and evacuate this city."
	msg_orc5_27="But it is beyond the Desert of Death, which is full of poisonous giant scorpions and outlaws.  And bypassing it would take ages!  Not to mention after this desert, we'll have to cross the Silent Forest!"
	msg_orc5_28="So we have no choice ... I've never tasted scorpions but sure, this journey promises to be fun."
	msg_orc5_3="I propose that Gork, you and I call for reinforcements."
	msg_orc5_4="Call for reinforcements?  Do you mean you don't want to fight for our brothers?  Are you a coward, Vraurk?"
	msg_orc5_5="Me?  I'll show you if I'm a coward!"
	msg_orc5_6="It is not time for quarreling!  I'm to contain them, go find reinforcements."
	msg_orc5_7="This is a wise choice.  Good luck, son of the Black Eye."
	msg_orc5_8="Haha!  Our plan is going well, let surround them on land while our allies attack them from sea!"
	msg_orc5_9="We are attacked from both sides!  Grüü, hold them while I run to Tirigaz to find forces to counter attack.  Although we can't defeat those pirates without naval forces, we can wipe humans out of this region."
	msg_orc6_1="It's been two days since we entered this desert.  I have never been so hot and we have nearly finished our food."
	msg_orc6_10="We've done it!  Now we need some rest, before we continue our journey."
	msg_orc6_2="I'm hungry and we found no giant scorpion yet.  I'm sure it would be delicious."
	msg_orc6_3="I hope we won't find one!  They are terrible armored beasts and your troll clubs are useless against their heavy shells."
	msg_orc6_4="I've been told the best way to defeat them is to attack their eyes with sharp blades.  But I hope too we won't meet them."
	msg_orc6_5="The sun is rising, we should resume our journey and find this oasis mentioned on the map before the sun get high."
	msg_orc6_6="Stay alert!  This oasis is known to be a den of outlaws and desert pillagers."
	msg_orc7_1="So here is the Silent Forest ... why is it named that way?  Is it really that silent?"
	msg_orc7_10="We've done it!  Now we need some rest, before we continue our journey."
	msg_orc7_11="No more elves?  Where are you cowards!?"
	msg_orc7_12="Don't shout that loud, stupid troll.  Do you remember we are in the Silent Forest?  Perhaps there more are to come."
	msg_orc7_13="I don't think so.  They must have fled.  Now that this forest has been cleared of elves, we can have a rest and then continue our journey."
	msg_orc7_2="It has not always been that silent.  A lot of hunters from tribes used to hunt there and fish in the Bork river.  But now, no one would enter there unless forced."
	msg_orc7_3="Some people say these woods are haunted."
	msg_orc7_4="The fact is that few people entered this forest and returned home safe.  Most likely, this forest is full of elvish renegades."
	msg_orc7_5="Anyway, we need some rest.  We are sufficiently armed to cope with a bunch of elvish poachers.  If we ever meet some, I'll push them into the Bork river with great delight."
	msg_orc7_6="What is that?  Orcs entering our forest?  Fools!  None of them will return alive!"
	msg_orc7_7="I agree.  We'll attack them on both sides."
	msg_orc9_1="At last, here are the mourned hills!  I hope everything will be OK."
	msg_orc9_10="Exasperated, Kapou'e launched an attack on his fellow orc Shan Taum the Smug."
	msg_orc9_2="Why?"
	msg_orc9_21="Nooo!  Don't kill me, I surrender to you little earthworm."
	msg_orc9_3="Only trolls don't know that these lands are ruled by Shan Taum the Smug, who was a rival for Black Eye Karun."
	msg_orc9_30="What is this?  Are you mad!?  Humans are to besiege our fortress at Prestim and you are fighting each other!?"
	msg_orc9_31="Well, ermmm..."
	msg_orc9_32="Kapou'e, rumors tell you made a long trip to seek assistance from us, and escorting Pirk, Gork and Vraurk.  The council is grateful for that."
	msg_orc9_33="I know what you want from us but I'm afraid we can't help you."
	msg_orc9_34="Really?  But my people..."
	msg_orc9_36="You don't understand.  Orcs have been divided for ages.  The only one who gave us some unity was your father, Black Eye Karun.  Hearing rumors from your exploits, we understood you are a worthy son of your father."
	msg_orc9_37="This is true.  Now we are pressured from all sides by humans and elves; we need a leader that can unite all banners.  This one is YOU!"
	msg_orc9_38="Well, I'm not sure I deserve that..."
	msg_orc9_39="Did you hear?  There is a battle waiting for us at Prestim!"
	msg_orc9_4="I doubt he would welcome the son of the Black Eye."
	msg_orc9_40="Kapou'e, if Prestim falls, humans will have a strong bridgehead on this side of the river and your people won't be safe.  You are the only one that can help us defend Prestim!"
	msg_orc9_41="Leave your people here Kapou'e--they are safe for the moment--and go defend Prestim.  In the meantime, now that the council is complete again, we will decide if we have to form the Great Horde again and give you the leadership on it."
	msg_orc9_5="Who is that?  Kapou'e!  What are you doing in my lands you ridiculous born loser?"
	msg_orc9_6="Hold on, Shan Taum. We are not here to quarrel, we are here to escort our brothers and to deliberate about what we have to do."
	msg_orc9_7="Bwahaha!  You are nothing!  Where is your land?  You became a beggar.  You are as pathetic as your father!"
	msg_orc9_8="How can you talk that way about my father, you miserable coward?!  I'll make a mug with your skull!"
	msg_orc9_9="Really?  What would you drink with it?  Mint cordial?"
	msg_orc_10_1="Reinforcements, at least!  Whoever you are, you are welcome in Prestim!  The fortified bridge over the Gork river has been taken this morning by a small commando of elves, we already tried to assault it twice without success."
	msg_orc_10_2="Ah!  They are no match against my mace."
	msg_orc_10_3="There is worse, our scouts reported that our saurians allies led by Inarix are still blocked on the other side of the river some miles away. They won't be able to cross the river."
	msg_orc_10_4="Elves and dwarves have joined humans against us and are camping near.  Humans will arrive soon.  We must destroy the southern bridge on the river."
	msg_orc_10_5="We must do something!"
	msg_orc_10_6="I know what we must do.  Kill elves and help Inarix cross."
	msg_orc_10_7="It won't be that easy!  Our enemies are well entrenchered.  And don't forget, we will sabotage the southern bridge as soon as the bulk of Saurians army will have crossed!"
	msg_orc_10_8="Each warrior trapped on the bridge or on the other side of the river will perish!"
	msg_orc_17_1="We're safe, finally.  Hurry up Kapou'e, come with us, we need to reach Tirigaz as soon as possible."
	msgcrossroads1="Stay on the path! The hills here are not safe!"
	msgcrossroads2="Beware the hills! There are many Orcs in hiding, preparing to ambush you!"
	msgcrossroads3="Here we come to the great cross-roads. We should go north-east."
	msgcrossroads4="Beware! These hills are not safe! The roads are important to Asheviere's strategy, and she has hired Orcs to guard them. We shall have to fight to travel them."
	msgcrossroads5="Then fight we shall. Let it begin!"
	msgcrossroads6="Victory is ours, men. Let us proceed north-east!"
	msgnw_1="This winter is bitterly cold! Perhaps we should stop here and rest a while."
	msgnw_10="And so after many days of rest, the party set out once again for the Dwarven kingdom..."
	msgnw_2="Stop and rest? My lord, we must go hard after the Scepter of Fire, lest it fall into the hands of our enemies!"
	msgnw_3="We have had a hard march ever since we were besieged by the undead in that foul valley. Now winter bears down upon us, and we have spent most of our money. This land looks fertile enough. Surely we can settle here for the winter!"
	msgnw_4b="Yes, let us rest a while! I am sure there are many challenges ahead, and I do not think I could endure another like the fording of the river for many days."
	msgnw_5="We are chasing the Scepter of Fire, the fate of the realm is in our hands, and you humans want to stop and rest? Onward, I say!"
	msgnw_6="They are right, Kalenz. I had wanted to acquire the Scepter within a moon, but it is not to be. Our soldiers will begin to desert if they do not rest soon. But in these wild north lands, we must fight even for the right to rest. Look to the north! Those foul orcs will not allow us any peace!"
	msgnw_7="Then we shall wrest control of the land from them. To arms men!"
	msgnw_8="Victory is ours! We have secured the land from the Orcs. Now we can rest here while the cold winter passes."
	msgnw_9="Let us not rest for too long though, friends. We must still reach the ancient Dwarven lands before our foes do."
	msgsnowplains1a="These fields of snow were once the home of my people. We left here centuries ago. Legends say a great sword of fire was left behind."
	msgsnowplains2="This sword may prove useful on our journey ahead. I wonder where it could be hidden."
	msgswamp1="This land is cursed. The Liches have lived here for years amassing great armies and fortunes."
	msgswamp2="The Liches are all over this swamp. I hope I have made a wise choice in taking this path."

	nelves_11="When my lord learnt of your coming, he sent riders out looking for you! There is trouble afoot!"
	nelves_12a="Trouble? What kind of trouble?"
	nelves_13a="We have sighted a great host to the south, a host of the men of Wesnoth. And we believe they are looking for you! There is not a moment to lose. You must make haste to the Elven forest. Only there will you be safe!"
	nelves_14a="I only hope we can avoid them. We will have to bear north-east."
	nelves_15a="That is not all, my lord. The foul Orcs have heard of the coming of these men, and are even now gathering a great host to oppose them to the north! It is now certain that there will be a great battle."
	nelves_16a="This sounds very dangerous. Perhaps we should retreat to the West, and hide until the battle is over?"
	nelves_17a="I think these wild lands are too dangerous for that! Anyhow...I expected you to be on the side of Wesnoth, Princess?"
	nelves_18a="I am an honorable princess, not an imposter like you! I promised that I would be on your side until we made it out of these lands, and I will keep my promise!"
	nelves_19a="Sir, madam, there is no time to lose! You must make it East, to the home of my people. Only there will you be safe!"
	nelves_2="After being in this wilderness for so long, it will be good to get some rest!"
	nelves_20a="Come then, Konrad, let us go."
	nelves_21a="My lord has begun assembling a party of Elves to come and escort you into the forest. Beware, for we are all in great danger!"
	nelves_22="Greetings, Elf-friend! Welcome to Emetria. You must take shelter here until the battle passes. If you stay with me here for a little while, we will all be safe."
	nelves_23="Thank you, Lord El'rien. The hospitality of the North Elves is as generous as of your kin in the South! My men will help you hold out against our enemies."
	nelves_24="Elf-friends, you have made it to safety!"
	nelves_25="El'rien, we have the Scepter of Fire with us! We must escort them to Elensia!"
	nelves_26="Indeed. We will escort you to our capital, where we will make Council."
	nelves_3a="But there is a great fog around us again! We don't know what dangers may lie ahead!"

	tut17="Indeed, Lofar, you were right. Humans can't lead armies."
	tut18="Konrad! You should have helped me!"
	tut19="Huh, human the leader! Wasn't telling you, Galdrad, it is waste of time?"
	tut2="What must I learn, Delfador?"
	tut20="Alright, Konrad. You were excellent today."
	tut21="This young commander deserves the crown of Wesnoth. Let him be our hope for peace with Wesnoth, Lofar."
	tut22="Congratulations, Human. Your performance today was impressive, I must admit."
	tut23="A mission of a great importance is before us. Asheviere must not remain queen any longer!"
	tut24="You did all the exercies, but four days was not enough for you to defeat bandits. I'm afraid you won't have so much time in real battle."
	tut25="Do not be so cautious, Konrad. Go yourself to the fight, if there is no risk to your life."
	tut26="You look miserable, Konrad. Four days have passed and you have not completed the exercises. In a real battle you must act quickly, before your enemies summon reinforcements. We will have to try again another time."
	tut27="Go to the two villages near the river."
	tut28="Now you have control over the majority of villages here. Well done!"
	tut29="So far, so good, but we need more of them."
	tut30="Excellent, human commander!"
	tut31="Well, fighter is an excellent choice for every battle, but I would use archers here instead. They are better shooters than fighters."
	tut32="Scouts are known for their horse riding. Here I would rather use archers, who can defeat the enemy before he is close enough to respond."
	tut33="This task is complete!"
	tut34="Archers are too weak to defeat poachers with swords. Attempting to attack one at a long range may be the last act of this archer's life!"

	tut53="Konrad, get on with it! They are not so many."
	tut54="All right, but you're wasting too much time."
	tut55="Konrad! This is your last warning -- put an end to them now!"
	tut56="This is a simple task! Why are you performing so slowly!"
	tut57="Well, hurry up!"
	tut58="So far, so good, but hurry up! I have one more task to do for you."
	tut59="You have too little time now, I must say."

	und2_14="I am dying, and my army is defeated! This is the end..."
	undbook_1="Time marched on, and so did Gwiti. He was nearing the grove where he now knew the dreadful tome of Crelanu to be hidden."
	undbook_10="A curse upon that necromancer! Why did he have to come here?!"
	undbook_11="At last! This is it! Now I must laugh crazedly as a true villain always must!"
	undbook_12="My lord, we have found the necromancer at last!"
	undbook_2="I feel that it must be close. Could it be in that swamp?"
	undbook_3="But the ancient mages had done their job well. The book had been hidden in a grove over which Elves and Orcs had waged war for many years, and any to approach would suffer their combined wrath..."
	undbook_4="Oh no. The orcs seem to have recruited the undead to their side."
	undbook_5="Blast it! However did the elves get a necromancer to march with them?"
	undbook_6="I side not with either of you!"
	undbook_7="The book is not here, but these swamps contain enough corpses to suit my purposes."
	undbook_8="What? I can't die! Noooo!"
	undbook_9="I die a terrible death... not knowing why."

	undead_tower_10="Gack! This chest contains holy water!"
	undead_tower_11="Look at what the mages were guarding!"
	undead_tower_12="Those mages had hidden away more than it seemed!"
	undead_tower_13="Two dozen gold. Plundering this tower is fun!"
	undead_tower_14="A pile of assorted coins is here!"
	undead_tower_15="Haha, this chest holds scores of gold coins!"
	undead_tower_16="This is not the tome Crelanu wrote...hmmm... but it contains its whereabouts!"
	undead_tower_17="We're done in here! Let's go slay some more enemies."
	undead_tower_2="If my memory serves, this tower should have three floors. I should be able to find the Book in a few hours...!"
	undead_tower_3="Hayaargghh! We have arrived! Command us, Master!"
	undead_tower_4="There's a secret door here! This must be the library."
	undead_tower_5="Well, well, well. Thirty-five pieces of gold were in this chest!"
	undead_tower_6="Blast it, the chest is empty!"
	undead_tower_7="Twenty pieces of gold is a welcome gift."
	undead_tower_8="I suppose thirty copper coins should not be scorned..."
	undead_tower_9="The chest is empty save for a few trinkets. The magic has gone out of them."
	undeadbrother_1="Back in Wesnoth, the sun set on the first battle of the war being waged. But here another war brewed, between brothers."
	undeadbrother_10="I...have failed to win this battle. I am defeated. I will not believe it."
	undeadbrother_11="Die, yes, die, and go to the Land of the Dead. Perhaps one day you will be back under my command!"
	undeadbrother_12="Didn't I tell you so?!"
	undeadbrother_13="And by my own hands you died!"
	undeadbrother_14="I am Gwiti the Mighty, prepare to die!"
	undeadbrother_15="Now you shall die!"
	undeadbrother_16="You miserable wretch, know that it is only by my mercy that you look upon the sun again, for you shall die before it sets."
	undeadbrother_17="May I remind you that even as we speak, my undead legions are marching towards you?"
	undeadbrother_2="Ah, hated brother mine. Look well upon the setting sun, for you shall not live to see another."
	undeadbrother_3="I did not live to see this one either. I gave up my life for necromancy, same as you. Do you remember?"
	undeadbrother_4="How well I do. But either way, prepare to die...again."
	undeadbrother_5="I will fight you with all my strength to prevent that, and I was always the stronger of us. Flee now and save your miserable hide before I make it a carpet."
	undeadbrother_6="Don't be silly! I'm not hairy enough to be a carpet! But your scalp would make a good pillow."
	undeadbrother_7="What? I can't die! I already have! Noooo!"
	undeadbrother_8="Ha ha ha, did I not tell you it would be so? Perhaps I shall summon your shade to serve me one day. Until then...farewell!"
	undeadbrother_9="It is over. I am doomed..."
	undeadmages_1="After sending the Dark Spirit away for his failure, Gwiti turned towards the Tower of Kaleon, where the greatest mages once studied."
	undeadmages_10="Quirind, we have failed! You must guard the tower."
	undeadmages_11="Ah ha ha ha! The tower's protective spells are now in force, you cannot enter without mastering a magic equal to it."
	undeadmages_12="Haha! I have gained entry to the tower!"
	undeadmages_13="A curse upon that foul necromancer!"
	undeadmages_2="At last, I have reached the main road. Unless I am far off my course, I should find the Tower of Kaleon here, filled with the secrets of ancient mages. Soon they shall all be mine, and my power will be great enough to invade Wesnoth."
	undeadmages_3="A necromancer approaches! I must send for aid."
	undeadmages_4="Accursed and dreadful one, know that we mages, guardians of the Tower of Kaleon, shall bar your way with all our spells! Flee now and you may survive."
	undeadmages_5="Quirind, know that you have the Elves at your back."
	undeadmages_6="Foul sorcerer of death, go far from this place or we shall send you to your own realm."
	undeadmages_7="Not born is the one that could challenge me!"
	undeadmages_8="No! No! Noooo! It is over, I feel the shades reaching for me..."
	undeadmages_9="Argh! I have fallen, and the Tower lies stripped of its defenses!"
	undeadrise_1="After his banishment from Wesnoth for practising necromancy, the young Gwiti Ha'atel arrived on a strange land. He decided to claim it for his own."
	undeadrise_10="The Wesnothians have discovered my escape! This is not good..."
	undeadrise_8="Noooo! Not now, not when I have escaped!"
	undeadrise_9="Argh! I die!"
	undeadskull_1="After Gwiti destroyed his brother, he planned to march on Wesnoth to gain his revenge. But a Dark Spirit came to counsel him..."
	undeadskull_10="It is not your banner, and it never was! That skull has marked it as mine since long ago."
	undeadskull_11="Argh! This is only half of the skull!"
	undeadskull_12="This skull is powerless!"
	undeadskull_13="That is not the skull of Agarash!"
	undeadskull_15="It's been a long time since I fought anything myself!"
	undeadskull_2="Gwitiii...Gwiti!"
	undeadskull_3="A Dark Spirit? Surely this is my token of mastery of the undead!"
	undeadskull_4="Gwiti, do not yet march in pursuit of your revenge. First, you shall go south, against the orcs, and there find the Skull of Agarash."
	undeadskull_5="What is the Skull of Agarash? Tell me more."
	undeadskull_6="Do you see the three orc clans of this land? Their banners are topped with skulls, as is their custom. But one of these is the Skull of Agarash - which once was mine. Take it and your power will grow greater by far."
	undeadskull_8="What? I can't die! I've done so already! Noooo!"
	undeadskull_9="Oh, no! The undead hordes have taken my banner!"
