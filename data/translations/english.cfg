tip_of_day10="Units that do not move or attack during their turn rest, and will recover 2 hitpoints at the beginning of their next turn."
tip_of_day11="Most foot units defend better in villages and castles than in most other terrain, while most mounted units don't get any defensive advantage in villages and castles."
tip_of_day12="Horse based units are generally resistant to attacks with bladed or impact weapons, but are vulnerable to attacks with piercing weapons, including bows and spears."
tip_of_day13="Inflicting the killing blow on an enemy unit is the best way to gain experience. Units killing an enemy will gain 8 experience for every level of the unit they kill."
tip_of_day14="Elvish units move and fight very well in forest. Dwarvish units move and fight very well in hills and mountains."

tip_of_day19="Your leader can recruit or recall units from any keep inside a castle, not just the keep they start on. You can capture a keep from an enemy and recruit from there. Also, some of your allies may be willing to make room for you on their keep so you can recruit there."

tip_of_day27="You can see how far enemy units can move by moving the mouse cursor over them."
tip_of_day28="Use healers to support your attacks - they will win you battles without needing to attack anything themselves."
tip_of_day29="The 'slow' attack ability makes enemy units move slower, but it also gives them one less attack than they would normally have. It is thus very effective against units that have a few powerful attacks."
tip_of_day30="Holy attacks are very powerful against undead."
tip_of_day31="Units are healed when they advance a level. Used wisely, this can turn a fight."
tip_of_day32="Charging units are best used against enemies they can kill with a single blow."
