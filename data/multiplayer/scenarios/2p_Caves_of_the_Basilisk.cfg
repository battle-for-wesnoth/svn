            unit_description=_ "The winds of the dark sky blew so cold,
The moon was high, the night was old,
Brave was the drake that dared forsake
His home to steal the Basilisk's gold.

On that dark night, the skies so churned,
He disregarded what he had learned,
Foolish but brave, to the Basilisk's cave,
He flew, and the fire within him burned.

Alas, that fire burns no more,
For the Basilisk, with one mighty roar,
Chilled him to the bone, and he turned to stone,
And so he stays forevermore.

The winds of the sky blow so cold,
The years pass by, the days are old,
Here stands that drake, who dared forsake
His home to steal the Basilisk's gold.

His leadership and skills alone were what kept the area's goblins alive despite human and elvish menaces. Rumor had it that his wolf had slain fifty men and a hundred Elves.
Thus, when he heard of the awful monster that was inhabiting the area, it was only natural that he ride out alone to face it. All the other goblins expected him to slay the creature easily and drag back its carcass to feast on.
He was in for quite a shock. As soon as he saw the Basilisk, Blum Duk cowered in fright. He tried to wheel his wolf around to run away, but it wouldn't move. As the creature stalked towards him, he screamed his last words: Good Gog, dog, are yer legs made of stone?!?

It was his lake, no other's, and though it was not large, he was its master. Then, the Basilisk came, and looked into the Serpent's eyes. And the Serpent had not died, but it was no longer alive. Thus the new lord of the lake had arrived.

Now all that is left is a stark reminder of his once great bearing and strength.

            unit_description=_ "Bramwythl the Wose was always considered a slow, taciturn fellow, even by other Woses. More than any other Wose, he enjoyed simply standing alone in the sun, arms upraised, admiring the beauty of the empty sky. Once, even, he confided in a fellow that his greatest wish was to be able to bask forever in the sun's glory.
However, not long after, the local wose community heard of the approach of a horrible monster, powerful enough to easily destroy the few woses that lived in the area. They quickly moved off (quickly for Woses, anyway), but Bramwythl was left behind - in their haste, no one had remembered to find him and tell him of the danger.
He was taken quite unawares by the Basilisk, and turned to stone before he even recognized the beast. His petrified form still stands there today, warmed by the sun's rays, under an open sky. His greatest wish has been granted.

According to the legend, the weapon rested somewhere on the bottom of this very lake (Ruaskkolin Lake, named for a well-known Sea Serpent who made it his home). Having prepared himself for battle with the Serpent, Rilhon met with two rather large surprises. The first was the petrified form of Ruaskkolin the Serpent. The second was the very-much-alive Chak'kso Ney'yks, who was, oddly enough, in possession of all of his teeth.

and taught the fishes how to speak to planets
silver green

running from her spirit into skins of kelp and shells of snails
a twisting of her tail and hands
she sent her songs to run on pin-tipped legs about the sands
and now
and now the strangest pause
for centuries
she hasn't moved her eyes
