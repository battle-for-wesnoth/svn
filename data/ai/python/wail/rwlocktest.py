# Most of these tests were shamelessly taken and adopted from
# Dmitry Dvoinikov's shared lock tests. As the lock implementations
# differ, the units tests were significantly changed but logically
# are identical. As Dmitry's lock implemetation is fully recursive,
# tests which require lock recursion have been removed.
#
# Special thanks to Dmitry for having his shared lock tests available.
# This test suite made it especially easy to find the tricky corner cases
# which plagued rwlock implementation.
