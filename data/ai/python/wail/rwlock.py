# A Reader/Writer lock implementation
# Copyright Greg Copeland, 2008
# Released under GPL license for Wesnoth. See Wesnoth's
# licensing terms for this's module's license.
#
# This is a non-recursive, reader/writer (shared) lock implementation.
# Recursive use of these locks will result in deadlock. Upgrading and
# downgrading of locks (reader -> writer and writer -> reader) are possible
# for many use cases. Don't forget, if the same thread attempts to grab
# a writer lock while currently holding the same writer lock, deadlock is
# ensured.
#
# My implementation has been inspired by Dmitry Dvoinikov's <dmitry@targeted.org>
# (recusrive) shared lock implementation. Despite his implementation, my implementation
# is distinct. My implementation provides writer fifo order by default unless reader
# biases is enabled at lock creation time. My implementation attempts to honor fifo
# ordering on lock requests; thusly preventing reader/writer starvation, which is common
# to Dmitry's (and others) implementation. Likewise, my lock implementation is fully
# deterministic, with or without reader bias, while his implementation is not. My
# implementation also avoids a potential race condition, which Dmitry's potentially has
# when using timeouts.
#
# If I do say so, this implementation is pretty speedy and yet still has room for
# additional optimization.
