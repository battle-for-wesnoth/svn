##    This is my attempt at a 'chess-like' AI.  All moves are motivated by
##    an underlying evaluation function.  The actual eval function doesn't
##    need to be coded, because moves can be scored and ranked based on the
##    incremental change in the evaluation.  Unlike a chess-playing program,
##    though, this program does no lookahead, because the branching factor
##    is prohibitively high (potentially in the thousands), and because then
##    the script would have to create an internal model of the game state.
##
##    Despite the lack of any lookahead, I still consider this AI to be
##    chess-like because it evaluates every possible move and attack, even
##    those that are obviously (to a human) bad.  How can a computer know
##    that these are bad moves unless it actually checks?
##
##    The evaluation function is:
##
##    (1)     side_score = village_score
##                         + sum(unit_score, over all units)
##                         + positional_score
##
##    The value of a unit can be highly subjective, but to simplify, assume
##    that any level-1 unit is just as valuable as any other level-1 unit.
##    Specifically, the value of a unit will be:
##
##    (2)     unit_score = (1 + level + %xp)(1 + %hp)
##
##    Leaders are be considered three levels higher than their actual level.
##    So a freshly-recruited level-1 unit is worth 4.0 points.  And a level-2
##    unit with half its hitpoints remaining, but halfway to level 3, is
##    worth 6.75 points.
##
##    One question is: How much is a village worth, compared to a (typical)
##    unit?  A typical unit is worth 15 to 20 gold, because that is how much
##    we paid for it.  A village is worth two or three gold *per turn* as
##    long as it is held.  (The village is worth three gold when it offsets
##    a unit's upkeep.)  So we must make some assumptions as to the value of
##    a present gold piece, compared to a future gold piece.  Assume a decay
##    rate of 1.5 (i.e. a gold piece one turn from now is worth two-thirds
##    of a gold piece now).  This makes the present value of a village equal
##    to twice its income.  If we set the value of a typical unit at 16 gold,
##    we get that an upkeep-offsetting village is worth 1.5 points, and a
##    supernumerary village is worth 1.0 points.  For simplicity, the value
##    of each village is set at 1.0.
##
##    (3)     village_score = number of villages
##
##    The positional score is the most interesting term of equation (1),
##    because that, more than anything else, will guide the AI's behavior.
##
##    First, we want the AI to expand to capture villages.  So, for each unit,
##    it is scored based on how far it is from the nearest unowned or enemy
##    village.  If the distance is zero, the unit has actually captured the
##    village, so in that limit, the value should be equal to the village
##    value.  As the distance approaces infinity, the score should tend
##    toward zero.  This suggests something like:
##
##    (4)     village_proximity = c / (c + distance)
##
##    I have selected c to be equal to equal to the unit's movement.   This
##    means that (approximately) a unit one turn away from capturing a village
##    gets 0.5 points; two turns, 0.33 points, etc.  Although an exponential
##    relationship would be more accurate, exponentiation is expensive, and
##    better avoided, since thousands of moves are evaluated per turn.
##
##    Second, we want units to stand on defensive terrain when within range
##    of the enemy.  The 'right' way to do this would be to count up all the
##    potential attackers at the destination square, see how much damage they
##    might do, and score the move based on how much damage would be dealt/
##    prevented.  Again, this is much too slow.  I have found a reasonable
##    approximation is:
##
##    (5)     exposure_penalty = -defense_modifier / 10
##
##    Maybe much too simple, but easy to calculate!  In future editions, perhaps
##    I should take into account how damaged the unit is, or at least make some
##    attempt to count the attackers.
##
##    Third, we want units to heal when damaged or poisoned.  Referring to
##    equation (2), we can see that the value of healing is:
##
##    (6)     healing_score = healing / max_hitpoints * (1 + level + %xp)
##
##    We consider poison, which does 8 damage *per turn*, to be equivalent to
##    16 points of actual damage, for the same reason a village's real value is
##    twice its income (see above).
##
##    Fourth, we want units to guard villages if the enemy is in range to take
##    them.  If, by stationing a unit on a village, we prevent the enemy from
##    taking it, we have prevented a 2-point swing in the enemy's favor.  Again
##    considering a decay rate of 2/3 per turn, this means the garrison value
##    is 4/3.  But since there is no guarantee that our garrison will be
##    successful (perhaps the enemy will take the village anyway; perhaps it is
##    not possible to garrison all threatened villages), we will cut this in half.
##
##    (7)     garrison_score = 2/3
##
##    Fifth, we want our leader to stay near a keep.  Otherwise, any gold we
##    might have accumulated will be wasted.  And finally, we want units to move
##    toward the enemy leader.  These are accomplished by treating keeps as
##    if they were unowned villages (for our leader), and the enemy leader
##    as if it were a village (for everyone else).
##
##    This should be all that is required to play a decent game of Wesnoth.
##    This AI scores quite well against the Wesnoth default AI, which may be
##    surprising, because it uses no sophisticated tools.  There is no attempt
##    to use any of the path-finding tools made available by the API (which
##    would be too slow to be used thousands of times every turn).  There is
##    no attempt to use combination attacks (meaning, that even though none of
##    several units can favorably attack a certain target, if they all attack
##    in the same turn, the result is likely to be favorable).  No attempt is
##    made to assign units individually to targets.
##
##    Some bad behaviors may result from these shortcomings:
##
##    If the map is maze-like, or simply has a few corners surrounded by
##    impassable terrain, units may get stuck.  On Cynsaun Battlefield, for
##    example, a group of units got stuck in the middle of the river, trying
##    to capture a village on the other side of the deep-water hexes.
##
##    An enemy unit may get completely surrounded by friendly units, who are
##    weak in comparison to the enemy, and our AI will make no attempt to kill
##    the enemy unit.  (Think six Wolf Riders surrounding an Orcish Grunt.)
##    Usually one or more of these units will find something else to do, allowing
##    a few Archers to take their place and start to wear down the Grunt.  Or
##    the Grunt will attack, getting damaged in the process, and creating a
##    chance-to-kill for one of the Wolves.
##
##    If there is an unoccupied village in a corner of the map, our AI will
##    send every unit that is closer to the village than any other, to that
##    village.  Often, only one unit is necessary.  Thus, harassing villages
##    with scouts may be a much more viable strategy against this AI than
##    against human players, or against the default AI.
##
##    For those interested in results, I have set up a tournament between my
##    AI and the default AI.  The tournament consists of one match on each of
##    the mainline two-player maps (except Wesbowl, naturally).  In each map,
##    each opponent is allowed to be player 1 once.  If there is no decision
##    after two games, two more games are played, repeating as necessary until
##    one opponent has won the match.  All games are played with a 50-turn
##    limit, 2 gold per village, 70% experience, and no fog.  (I think there
##    is a bug (feature?) that AIs ignore fog, so I disabled it to improve the
##    observer's (my) experience.)  Factions are chosen randomly.
