	description= _ "For the people of Dwarven Doors the choice was stark: either drudge as downtrodden slaves for the orcs until the end of their brief and miserable lives, or risk all for freedom and rise up against their cruel overlords. Little did they suspect that their struggle would be the hinge of great events that might either restore the Northlands to the glory they had once known, or doom them to an eternity of bloody chaos. (Expert level, 18 scenarios.)"
