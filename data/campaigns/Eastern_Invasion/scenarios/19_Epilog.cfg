As the lich's death-scream echoed in the air, a vast and louring column of shadow arose from his corpse like smoke from an unclean fire; then it divided fivefold at its height, reaching for the heavens like a clutching hand.
 
Men let weapons fall from nerveless fingers and horses reared in terror as that great dark pall obscured the sun..."
