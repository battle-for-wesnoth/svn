	story= _ "Cattle and beasts of burden were found dead in the fields, and men went missing from their houses, with no clues but a thin stream of black blood. At first the settlers suspected raiders from the great desert, but when they sent scouts east they found nothing but a small mountain range and miles of swamp."

	story= _ "The disappearances did not stop, and every day the terror grew greater. Eventually, the people living in the eastern villages sent a messenger to the King, asking for help. The messenger rode hard for many days and nights, and finally reached the city of Weldyn."

	story= _ "All went well once the King's forces arrived. There were no attacks for several weeks, and Gweddry's men started to grow incautious. Then, at dawn one day, Gweddry and his men were roused by the startled cries of the night watchmen..."
