0.1:
	* Initial release

0.2, 0.3:
	* Code identical to 0.1, these were tests for the upload code.

0.4:
	* Not putting villages omn the map edge banishes a hang bug that had
	the following symptom: "error engine: Cannot create unit:
	location is not on map, and player 5 has no recall list."

0.5:
	* Add changelog (good suggestion by turska)
	* Fixed recall of Aiglondur to work right if he leveled up.
	* Minor textual changes suggested by Turin Turambar.


0.6:
	* Fixes for all known WML bugs, notably the bandit-popup logic
	in Invaders (scenario 5). Props to zookeeper for the fixes.
	* Invaders (scenario 5) rebalanced.


0.7:
	* Scenario 7, "Mages and Drakes", added.
	* Scenario 8, "Fear", added.
	* Scenario 9, "Forbidden Forest", added but not balance-checked.

0.8:
	* New scenario #1 map/WML and tuneup of scenario #3 map by Taurus.

0.9:
	* Rebalance scenario 1.

0.10:
	* New scenario #1 map backed out as it doesn't fit the storyline.

0.11:
	* In "Fear" (#8), explicitly create the ulfserkers the AI won't
	recruit anymore. Also give all enemies the "Masked Dwarf" user
	description.

0.12:
	* "Forbidden Forest" (#9) seems reasonably well balanced now.
	* Added Staff of Righteous Flame in #10; I've tested that a mage
	can pick it up an a non-mage can't, but have not yet triggered the
	final strike.
	* First cut at "The Siege of Kal Kartha" (#10).

0.13:
	* Staff of Righteous Flame final-strike effect is working.
	* Balancing work on "The Siege of Kal Kartha" (#10).
	* "The Court of Karrag" (#11) written.
	* "Epilogue" (#13) written.
	* Only "The Underlevels" (#12) is not yet playable

	Note: For this version you will need svn trunk at r22132 or
	later.

0.14:
	* This version is being checked into mainline
	* New victory dialogue in "Strange Allies" (#3)
