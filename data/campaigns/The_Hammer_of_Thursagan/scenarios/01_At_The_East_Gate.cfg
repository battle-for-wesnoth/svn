    # in country that is wooded and mountainous, but scattered with
    # small human and dwarvish farms.  Aiglondur and his guards should
    # start from an underground keep on the west edge of the map, set
    # into the east edge of impassable mountains and marked "East Gate".

But soon enough they prospered once again. The dwarves begin mining their past for inspiration in ways to rebuild Knalga so it would be even greater than before, and began also reaching out for contact with their scattered kinfolk."

In the year 550 after the founding of Wesnoth, the captain of the East Gate received a warning that a small band of rogue orcs had been sighted."
