    description= _ "In the first years of the Northern Alliance, an expedition from Knalga seeks out their kin at Kal Kartha and to learn the fate of the legendary Hammer of Thursagan. The perils of their journey through the wild Northern Lands, though great, pale beside the evil they will face at its end.

Also note: This campaign requires the 1.3.x development version.  It will not run correctly under Wesnoth 1.2.x.

(Intermediate level, 13 scenarios.)"
