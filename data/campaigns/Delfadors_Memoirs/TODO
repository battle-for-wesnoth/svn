I see this occasionally, but haven't figured out how to reproduce it
yet.  I think it must be a bug in the core code implementing sighted
events.

That doesn't necessarily mean it should be considered novice-level.
See <http://www.catb.org/~esr/wesnoth/campaign-design-howto.html> for
discussion, in particular "Balancin Scenarios".  How do you rank
yourself as a player?

I couldn't reproduce this.  In fact, I've never seen Lleollyn get
killed on any level of difficulty.  Maybe you need to attack the
assasin more aggressively to take the pressure off him?

How did you manage this?  A 3rd or 4th-level mage shouldn't be
killable by a couple skeletons.  And in any case there's at least one
safe village to heal up in, in the tomb where the staff was.

Odd.  I didn't find it particularly difficult at Hard.  It's not like
Iliah-Malal is recruiting anything nastier than thugs and adepts; you
can inundate them with ghouls if you have to.

I've done this.

You pretty much have to do that, yes.
