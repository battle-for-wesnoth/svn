>I was playing on Hard.  I've attached an archive of all my replays.

I've done this.

>* Save the King: The AI settings here were annoying.  Garard's troops

>* The Portal of Doom: This level is too hard.  I won on my 6th try, with

>* Prince of Wesnoth: This was a bit tricky, because I went into it broke,
