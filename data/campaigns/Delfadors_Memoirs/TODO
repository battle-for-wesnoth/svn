This is a TODO list for the Delfador's Memoirs campaign
-------------------------------------------------------

Art issues
----------

See this forum thread: http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=24805

WML issues
----------

Bad guys need to be unshrouded during dialog in 20 and 21.

Tweak custom terrains in 19 so they don't trigger an illegal-map error.

Invoke Iliah-Malal when Delfador gets near the portal, rather than on
a fixed turn?

Balance and design issues
-------------------------

19 needs some reworking.  It's intended to require the user to run a fighting
retreat and evacauation in the face of huge numbers, but player is presently
forced to stand and fight because the Ghost-line units have a mobility edge
in the rough terrain.  We might have t change the map, limit the bad guys to
slow units, and/or cange the timing of Iliah/Malal's arrival

Finish the walkthrough and put it on the wiki.
