ShadowMaster's review
---------------------
02:29 <Shadow_Master> Chantal does a funny MUF at the end of Return of Trouble
02:31 <Shadow_Master> "Save the King" is not very asthethically pleasing.
02:32 <Shadow_Master> but perhaps esr couldn't think of a way to make it look better in such a small area (harhar)
02:33 <Shadow_Master> two consecutive storyscreen scenarios afterwards. suspicious.
02:37 <Shadow_Master> "Showdown in the...": I hate scenarios in which units talk to other units under shroud.
02:40 <Shadow_Master> "Prince of Wesnoth": oh my ******g god, another scenario in which units speak under fog/shroud. But I guess this is a way to remind people that Wesnoth Is Not Realistic, huh?
02:42 <Shadow_Master> (i.e. FotE is monotonous. Not unlike DiD's "Alone at Last" series, anyway)
