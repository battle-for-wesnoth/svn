        #       story=_ "Delfador's suddenly-awakened suspicions were justified. Asheviere, frustrated in her ambitions, had suborned one of the mage's servants and gained access to the Book of Crelanu. Alas for the Kingdom that she came of a family in which the talent for magic ran strong, and that her early experiments did not consume her before she mastered the perilous secrets of the Book and fell entirely into evil."

            # Asheviere was already having secret talks with
            # the orcs about the early HttT events and Lionel's mission
            story=_ "Upon his return Delfador found out that the queen had left with a strong escort to visit her hometown and her ailing parents. Lionel, the King's most loyal general, had been sent at Asheviere's request on an errand to Knalga to retrieve the scepter of fire. That mission would cost Lionel his life; and neither Lionel nor Delfador knew that Lionel's mission had been compromised from the start."

            story= _ "Although the King did reprimand Eldred for his actions, Delfador could sense that the military commanders were solidly behind Eldred and his mother. Asheviere had flattered them and beguiled them with promises of glory and plunder in a coming war."

            story= _ "Delfador was granted an audience with the King and expressed his concerns about the Book, but the King suggested  that everything would be clear when Asheviere returned to Weldyn. And for once, Delfador knew he could not obey the King's order."

            story= _ "Since he could not ask even his personal guard to go against the King's wishes, he turned to Kalenz and the elves. Traveling by night to remain unseen they reached Asheviere's hometown, only to find that Asheviere was in fact staying at her father's manor, outside her hometown, and had left on a trip north. The Book was within their grasp."
