The Wesnoth army had been destroyed, with the few survivors had fled in terror. Nothing stood now between Iliah-Malal's army and Weldyn...."

This is a disaster. I should have led the army myself and died with them. And I should have listened to you, Delfador."

My Lord, things are very grave indeed, but all is not yet lost. There is still hope if we do not falter."

Yes, Delfador. This time we will follow your advice."

There are three things we must do. First, we must organize our defenses as best we can. Second, we need to ask the elves to create a diversion, to distract and delay Iliah-Malal. The elves will not be able  to fight the undead head on on the field, but they can harass them by striking from forests where the undead dare not follow. And last, I have been studying and I think I now know how to close Iliah-Malal's portal to the Land of the Dead. I will need a small escort, but this must be done immediately."

These are only the first steps. If we are  to defeat the undead, we need to use and train the army differently than we have. First, you must recall every mage in Wesnoth, from Alduin and elsewhere. And you must prepare more heavy infantry."

But Heavy Infantry is too slow! And mages in the army? Who can command these know-it-alls?"

Delfador could. You will command the heavy infantry. Make sure to shield the mages in battle, for they are precious. Now, go, close the portal and come back soon!"
