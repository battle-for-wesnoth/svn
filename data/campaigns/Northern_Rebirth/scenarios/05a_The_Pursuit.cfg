# Start sequence
# Set up map, TOD scheudle, variables, place images, objects, units, execute start event
# Leads the story to the crossroads
	{campaigns/Northern_Rebirth/scenarios/05a_The_Pursuit_files/start_sequence.cfg}

# From this point on we can go in seven directions, one of these leads to enemy castle and has no events involved, another one
# leads only to holy water storage and as such is merged into study module. Out of the remaining, going clockwise, we have :

# Prison
	{campaigns/Northern_Rebirth/scenarios/05a_The_Pursuit_files/prison.cfg}

# Treasury
	{campaigns/Northern_Rebirth/scenarios/05a_The_Pursuit_files/treasury.cfg}
	
# The Great Chamber
	{campaigns/Northern_Rebirth/scenarios/05a_The_Pursuit_files/the_great_chamber.cfg}
	
# Malifors Study and holy water storage
	{campaigns/Northern_Rebirth/scenarios/05a_The_Pursuit_files/study.cfg}
	
# The flooded path
	{campaigns/Northern_Rebirth/scenarios/05a_The_Pursuit_files/flooded_path.cfg}

# All of the above will ultimately lead to a door and a final confrontation
	{campaigns/Northern_Rebirth/scenarios/05a_The_Pursuit_files/final_confrontation.cfg}

# And usual batch of hero death macros
