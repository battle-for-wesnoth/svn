	story= _ "Scattered around Hidel were the bodies of at least three orcish warlords, and nearly a score of grunts, warriors and crossbowmen. His weapons were notched and broken; his armor dented and smashed. It was clear to all that his fall had been an epic of valor and glory, worthy to be remembered in the songs of all the kindred races until the end of days."

She took command of the surviving elvish forces, for all knew she was a princess of high rank and looked to Hidel's ward as their leader by right. Scarcely a face among them was less grim than her own as they took arms and started down Rakshas's back-trail."
