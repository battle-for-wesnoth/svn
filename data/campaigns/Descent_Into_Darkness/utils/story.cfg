            story=_ "So reads the book that Malin has reclaimed. 'The spells of necromancy bind the spirit, but only once it has been unbound from the body. To attain lich-dom, the mage must make the necessary incantations with his dying breaths. He thus binds his own spirit in much the same way necromancers bind the spirits of others. Because he retains his own will, however, the lich can call upon the awesome powers of the spirit world.'"

            story=_ "The words, and the idea, stick in the back of his mind. With all of Wesnoth forbidden to him, Malin finds refuge in a nameless frontier village where few questions are asked. When word filters to the town that Parthyn has been overrun by orcs, it rekindles hatred within him. With renewed purpose, he raises his undead minions and travels northward."

            story=_ "Malin soon finds the track of an enormous orc army, and follows them until he reaches their camp. As he sees the number of orcs, the enormity of his quest begins to dawn on him. He attacks the camp anyway but is quickly driven back, and badly injured by a thrown orcish dagger as he retreats. He finds refuge in a small cave."
