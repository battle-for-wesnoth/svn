            story= _ "True to his word, once Earl Lanbec'h had been slain, Howgarth III dispersed the Earl's forces and withdrew them from Orcish territory. For his part Kapou'e withdrew from Dorset and dispersed the Great Horde. However, before the horde was dispersed he appointed three more shamans - with the unanimous consent of all - to make the Great Council complete again."

            story= _ "As they did his father, Howgarth III issued an invitation to Kapou'e to join the Northern Alliance. Kapou'e declined. Instead he went back to Barag Gór and, making that his capital, established himself as sovereign over all the northern tribes."

        [part]
            story= _ "Kapou'e ruled for many years, and those years were a time of unprecedented prosperity and unity for the orcs. Under the leadership of Kapou'e, the united orc forces thoroughly scoured their territory of any renegade bands of humans, dwaves, elves, and undead. Agreements were thrashed out to the effect that orcs desiring to trade would have free passage anywhere in orcish territory without hinderance from other tribes."

        [part]
            story= _ "During the eighth year of Kapou'e's reign, and then again in the fourteenth, the orcish territories were once again invaded, first from the elves, and then once again from the humans. Almost as a testament to the power of the orcs united - both attacks were quickly and decisively crushed, even before the Northern Alliance could intervene."

        [part]
            story= _ "In order to keep fighting between the tribes to a minimum, Kapou'e also maintained an enormous army, drawn from all corners of his empire. To offset the cost of maintaining such an army, he often hired out portions of it to act as mercenaries in foreign struggles. People of all races took advantage of this and, consequently, those orcs thirsting for battle got more then enough to keep them from attacking their nearest neighbors."
