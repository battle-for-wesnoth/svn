            story= _ "So impressed was Rahul with the intelligence, prowess and leadership of Black-Eye Karun that he invited him to bcome a Lord Companion of the Northern Alliance. After much deliberation Black-Eye Karun decided to accept the offer. However, on the way to the city of Dwarven Doors - the headquarters of the Northern Alliance - Karun and his small group of bodyguards were attacked and slain to the last man. There were no survivors to confirm the incident, but it soon became believed among the orcs that the Northern Alliance had deliberately set up this ambush in order to break the unity of the orcs by slaying their paramount leader."

            story= _ "The peace treaty still held however, partially because the treaty - although arranged by the Northern Alliance - was between the local earldoms and didn't have any direct connection with the Northern Alliance. The other - and perhaps main - reason why the treaty held was that with the death of Black Eye Karun, the unity of the orcs was shattered and they once again descended into inner squabbling. Thus the years that followed were relatively peaceful and prosperous - for the humans anyway."

The few orcish tribes who had remained part of the Alliance, feeling the pressure, either left Alliance territory or revolted and were destroyed."
