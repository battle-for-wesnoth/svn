		story= _ "Kapou'e and his followers made a grueling march across the frozen Northlands. For the orcs it was a constant nightmare of freezing, marching and fighting. Food was scarce, and the stores that they managed to seize from rebellious tribes had to be strictly rationed. Many of the weaker orcs who weren't killed in combat died from exhaustion, or fell behind and froze to death."

		[part]
		story= _ "Throughout this nightmare Kapou'e drove himself and his men ruthlessly. The spring thaw would soon be upon them and with it, the human army that Earl Lanbec'h was no doubt rallying. By that time the orcs had to be united one way or another, since if they were separated and scattered, they would surely be exterminated."

		story= _ "And so they marched on, persevering in weather that would kill even the most hardened human, and through fierce bloody battles with belligerent tribes."
