		[part]
		story= _ "Kapou'e vowed that this would not happen. Events had the smell of a treacherous plot aimed at destroying the unity of the orcs. Furthermore, if the tree-shagger was to be trusted, then Shum Taum the Smug was behind it all. What an orc expected to gain from destroying his own race was beyond Kapou'e, but he decided to march to Bitok personally and confront the traitor. Bitok being was on the far side of orcish territory, this would also give him a good chance to clobber the orcs together again - the old fashioned way."

		[part]
		story= _ "Furthermore, the troops who had been led by Kapou'e this far had grown to respect him as a wise and capable leader, and they proclaimed their loyalty to him. Delighted, Kapou'e sent detachments off in different directions to bring in the other tribes, by force if necessary. Al'Brock was sent west, along the route that Kapou'e had used to flee the human forces almost a year before. Flar'Tar was sent directly south to rally the tribes along the Mountains of Haag and the eastern Mourned Hills. Kapou'e himself made a direct southwest beeline towards Bitok. They were all to meet in Dorset that spring to repel the human attack that seemed certain to come."
