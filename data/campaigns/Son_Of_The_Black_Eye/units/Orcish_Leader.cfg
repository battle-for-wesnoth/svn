unit_description= _ "Orcish Leaders are the chiefs of their tribe. They make the important decisions and lead their people into battle. They carry a bow out of necessity, but are much more skilled with the sword; all in all, they are powerful fighters. Their natural leadership skills make them very precious in battle: if the Leader is lost, so is the battle."
