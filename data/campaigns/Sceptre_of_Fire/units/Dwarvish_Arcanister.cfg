unit_description= _ "The most powerful of all the runecrafters, the Dwarvish Arcanister destroys wounded enemies almost instantly, and rarely fails to cause a wound when that is his intent. His skill in runecrafting is unrivaled, and the glyphs he carves into his weapons and armor deflect the blows of his enemies."
