	story= _ "To the southwest lay the Midlands. These were prosperous kingdoms, nestled between hill and forest. They served as the bread basket of a people, as well as a valuable source of both lumber and gemstones. These kingdoms fed the city of Southbay, the largest city on the Isle.

	story= _ "The river road follows the Isle's greatest river to the southeast. This road leads to the Isle's second largest city, Clearwater Port. It would likely have been the Isle's largest city save for the events of the Wesfolk War. The Lich-Lords befouled much of the land around the river during the course of a great battle. Now the swamp is home to a Wesfolk-imitating cult."
