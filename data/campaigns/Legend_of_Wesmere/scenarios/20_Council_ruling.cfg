Kalenz, the council has called you here to demand you apologize for your actions. You took the decision to help the humans in Weslath, and hence risk further war with the Orcs; to strike at the orcs north; and last to attack the Saurians. These were decisions to be taken by the council, not by a field commander! "

With all respect my lords, we were and still are in a war. We could not have the time to consult with you, lest our opportunities slip from our grasp and make the war longer and more costly. Besides, all our actions have been beneficial to our cause: The orcs are now in a civil war for succession, the North Elves are free and the Saurians no longer a threat."

The council is not blind to these benefits. But, still, you cannot decide high matters of statecraft on behalf of the Elves. We cannot allow it."

If it weren't for Kalenz and his men, none of us would be here to argue the point today. "

I agree. What's done is done. Let us concentrate on the future, not the past. "

Kalenz, the council has decided that you are to be stripped of all military authority. You may now go."
