            story=_ "The great elvish hero Kalenz was born in a quiet green wood in Lintanir on the fringes of the Great Northern Forest. Though not of noble birth, he showed early promise in the arts of his people. His quick intelligence gained him more than usual respect among elders normally inclined to pay little heed to anyone younger than a century old."

But some were very bad, and the worst of those was the coming of the orcs, the wreckers, the tree-killers. The years of Kalenz's long childhood were a golden age, and the last time of untroubled peace."

Kalenz came of age in the very year that Erlornas of Wesmere fought the first orcish raiders. Within the next decade orcish raids greatly increased, and their shadow loomed ever greater over the elves.

This is the story of Kalenz, and of the Elves in the days of the humans in Wesnoth."
