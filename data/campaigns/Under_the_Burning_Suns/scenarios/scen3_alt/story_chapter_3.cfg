            story= _ "Chapter 3: As we continued north through the desert, the looming hills and mountains promised blessed relief from the seemingly never-ending sand. Soon we got to the end of the foothills, and we decided to rest there for the night. As tired as I was of marching across the sand, I felt strangely afraid. I had lived my entire life in the sands; they were my home, and the rocky hills and white glistening mountaintops seemed foreign and foreboding."

            story= _ "I worried if I was doing the right thing, leading my people to strange lands. Despite Eloh's promises, I was not as confident as Zhul was that it would all end well. Looking back I thought it strange that I was the one that Eloh showed herself to. I was never particularly devout, always worried more about day to day matters than the extra-worldly ones. But who was I to question a god?"

            story= _ "That night, as I slept, I dreamt again, for the first time since that first fateful night. Eloh came to me again, and this time she appeared in a vision as a beautiful glowing figure, as bright as the suns. She said 'Have courage, for though soon you shall go through a time of darkness, all your trials shall be richly rewarded in the end. You must go under the northern mountains, not over them. You will find the ruins of an ancient watch tower made of black obsidian in the desert by the edge of the hills. By that tower you will find the entrance to the tunnels you seek. Follow the smooth ancient tunnel down under the mountains and when you again see the sky and my suns, I shall contact you. But beware those who lurk in the darkness, they hide from my light, and must not be trusted. I have no power in the dark, so you are my hand of justice. Punish the non-believers. Go now, and fear not the dark.' And again, just like before, I was woken up by a shout in the night. "
