            story= _ "Chapter 4: We found the crumbling obsidian tower that Eloh had described, and we camped at the edge of the foothills before the mountains. I was still shocked by the loss of Garak and all the other elves who fell in the battle last night. There was so much death in this land, was it always this way? As we traveled I pondered what this world must have been like back before the Great Fall and I remembered the tale that had been told to me many times since I was a child:"

        [part]
            story= _"A long, long time ago was the golden age among elves. Our people lived in harmony with nature in lands filled with trees, trees as far as the eye could see. There was peace among Elves and the other races such as Humans and Dwarves, and the evil creatures were driven deep within the earth. The foul name of Uria was not yet known among our people, and our powers were so great that we raised another sun into the sky, so that the days were lengthened and dark hours were few. Happy indeed were our people during these long years, but it was not to last forever."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _"Eventually peace and prosperity fostered corruption and decadence. Through her powers of deception and guile Uria cultivated secret groups of followers, promising to fulfill their darkest desires. She bided her time, and slowly stretched her black hands out across the world. At first, petty arguments between humans, elves and dwarves erupted into conflicts, embroiling our people in the first wars they had fought for ages. Then orcs and other foul creatures came back into the world and raided our settlements, razing villages and massacring hundreds. Uria's followers studied the necromantic arts and raised armies of undead. Our people had grown weak and soft in the time of peace and plenty and were ill-suited to cope with these new trials. Even nature herself seemed to quail under the onslaught: crops failed, the trees sickened and our forests started to die. Most disturbing was the way the nights lengthened, creating the long dark we suffer today. Many of our people despaired, and many embraced the oncoming darkness, worshiping Uria in hopes of saving themselves. Former friends fought over what few resources remained, and chaos threatened to overwhelm us all."

        [part]
            story= _"In this time of troubles Eloh first appeared to a select number of us, those few that still doggedly fought to preserve our homeland and our heritage. She told us that the old days had ended and only through strict discipline and strength could we survive in the new world. She led us out of the few remaining forests, which were being logged and burned by the orcs, into the open plains where we could roam freely. She taught us that alone we are weak, but together we can still strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. We learned that the only way to survive in this new harsh world was to always value the needs of the many over the wants of the individual. We must all work together, for without each other we are nothing. Even as the plains dried up into deserts we continued to follow her will and walk in her path, remembering our ancestors and the sacrifices they made that we might live, and always looking to create a better world for our children."

        [part]
            story= _"Was the golden age just a story? What kind of world could I be able to create for future generations of our people? All I knew of the past were the ruins of great castles and tales of a time when life was more than just a struggle to survive. Life did not seem to have grown easier for my people in the last few generations--if anything the land grew even more unforgiving. Was there anywhere left in this world that I could take my people which would be any better than the land we were born into?"
