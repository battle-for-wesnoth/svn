He motioned us to be very quiet and we crept forward; all I could hear was the soft patter of feet and my heavy breathing. Even that little noise seemed to echo off the cramped walls of our rough-hewn passage. I was suddenly aware of the sheer mass of rock and earth above us and for a moment I despaired of ever seeing the sun again. Then I grabbed my sword with fresh determination and vowed to see this mission through."

All that separates us from the trolls is a thin wall of stone. I've had me boys mine the end of the tunnel with explosives; when you move a unit adjacent to the final wall, I'll blow the charges and open the way. The troll leader should only be lightly defended; he's sent most of his best warriors to the front. You'll know the head troll when you see him, he's big, green and extra ugly."
