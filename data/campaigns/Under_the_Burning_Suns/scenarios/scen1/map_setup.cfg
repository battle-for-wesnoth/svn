# It's a good practice to name the scenario file according to scenario id. It's even better to put a scenario number in front 
# of the name, in this way if anyone in future will have to do something with your files he or she won't have to waste time
# on finding out in what order should he read the scenarios.

			story= _ "Note: This campaign is probably not the best one for beginners. It changes certain Wesnoth standards, such as the elves' stats and the day/night cycle. This campaign emphasizes role-playing elements and tends to have longer scenarios with changing objectives. For these reasons I strongly suggest that you occasionally save your game mid-scenario, so you won't lose all your progress if you get stuck and have to start over."

			story= _ "Chapter 1: I, Kaleh, grew up amidst the shifting sands, under our two suns Sela and Naia. It was a land of hot dry days and cold nights, of roaming horrors, where water was more valuable than gold. We had lived among the sands ever since the forests fell eons ago. It was a hard savage land, but we were tougher still, and we managed to survive settled around a rare oasis. We had heavily fortified our village against any marauders and we were the biggest encampment we knew of. My uncle, Tanuil, led us for many years, and trained us to be self-sufficient and strong against all enemies. A people struggling in an ocean of sand, we thought we were ready for anything. All that changed one fateful night, when the sky rained fire..."

			story= _ "I remember that night as if it were yesterday. I was not prone to dreaming, but as I slept I had a strange vision. I didn't have long to ponder it though, because I was woken in the dark by the sound of deafening crashes, splintering wood and shouting elves. That night the sky rained flaming rocks, boulders bigger than you could imagine. They smote the landscape like lightning bolts, setting fire to whatever could burn and crushing houses, walls, and elves. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to go for protection. I was so afraid, I thought that if I tried to flee I would be smashed, so I hid and prayed to Eloh. I never prayed before as hard as I did that night. I heard cries and screams outside, but I could not force myself to move. And somehow, eventually the thin yellow tendrils of a sickly dawn stole over the horizon, as if Naia herself were shocked by the devastation she saw."
