#ifndef EDITOR
# This makes gray shallow water transition on top of the wooden floor, which
# otherwise would have a hard edge; the color-shift values aren't spot-on
# (because we're shifting ocean to match color-shifted coast-tropical) so a
# transition is drawn both ways to hide it.
#
# This is #ifdef'd away for the editor because otherwise the transition would
# always work in the editor and give the false impression of working outside
# UtBS.
