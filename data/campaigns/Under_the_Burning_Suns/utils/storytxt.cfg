            story= _ "Chapter 9: Nym and Esanoo led us north, across the sands and through the dunes, towards the human encampment where the merfolk were being held. I asked Nym where Esanoo had come from, but she wouldn't answer, she just said that I had to see for myself."

            story= _ "Just then we crested over the last dune and I indeed saw what she meant. Sparkling blue covered the entire horizon. I fell to my knees in awe, I had never seen so much water in one place. I cannot write down in words the shock and amazement I felt. To have grown up in a land where water was as precious as gold, and then see miles and miles of it. It was only then that I understood where the merfolk truly came from. I'd been to some strange places, high up in the mountains, deep down under thousands of tons of rock, but this world of water was the most alien of them all."

            story= _ "Which brings me to the other alien concept I was trying to figure out: our goddess Eloh. What was her plan? Why did she want me to surrender to the humans? Do the humans worship her as well? The humans seem so brutish and vile, that I can't imagine them worshiping the same god. I thought Eloh was just our god, I don't remember Zhul mentioning any other races worshiping her after the Great Fall, though perhaps things have changed. Her commands don't make any sense; she doesn't seem at all like the goddess Zhul told me about. And what was Esanoo talking about? How did his master know about 'Yechnagoth' and 'Yanqui'? If Eloh won't help me, then I really need some answers. I pray to whatever gods may be left that I'm not leading my people into a trap..."
