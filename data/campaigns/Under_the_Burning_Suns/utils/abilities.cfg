# These are all direct clones of the mainline healing abilities, except that
# they are set to exclude units suffering from dehydration. Dehydration is only
# delayed by healers, so they must not actually heal a dehydrated unit any
# hitpoints.
#
# The ability macros go into wesnoth textdomain since the strings are identical
# to their core counterparts, but the special notes belong to wesnoth-utbs.
