# This file contains message to display when heroes die
# It is used until Scenario 12

# This version contains the troll/dwarf ally death event. I don't include
# the event in previous scenarios because I haven't defined the variable
# $ally_name.

# Also contains Esanoo's and Kromph's (the flesh golem) death cries
