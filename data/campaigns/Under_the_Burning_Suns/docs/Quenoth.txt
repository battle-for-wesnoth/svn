The purpose of this document is to give Kitty, 
who is doing new portrait art for UTBS and Zeroviros, 
who is doing new sprite art for UTBS ideas to work with.

This is necessary because I don't want to go with the current Quenoth elve faction.

The reason for this are:
UTBS is a rather special campaign but the player's faction is just a badly made rip off of the normal (woodland) elves.

So let's first discuss what is wrong with the current Quenoth elves faction.

The Fighter, being very similar to his woodland counterpart is more or less obsolete.
In most situations the Hunter is superior.

That is also true for the shaman line whose slowing ability is no longer unique but can be found in the Hunter line as well.
Since the Hunter is much more what you can call a front-unit there is not much point
in using the shaman for slowing anymore.
That reduces the usage of the shaman to a pure healer and the Quenoth elves to Wesnoth's only faction that features a unit
dedicated to healing only.


Now follows Espreon's and mine imagination of what could evolve from the woodland elves 
throwing in that new environment.


The Quenoth elves are currently lawful differing from the woodland elves who are neutral.
I deny that there is any sense in that change.
Why should a neutral faction change to a lawfully one when specializing to a desert?

Deserts tend to be hot during daytime and cold at night.
A quote from wikipedia:
"These winds cause the Gobi to reach extremes of temperature ranging from –40°C (-40°F) in winter 
to +50°C (122°F) in summer.
The climate of the Gobi is one of great extremes, combined with rapid changes of temperature, 
not only through the year but even within 24 hours (by as much as 35 °C or 61 °F)."
Remember that we have only one sun around on earth.

I don't buy that a neutral faction would specialize on the daytime, why should it?

Humans on earth that live in such an environment are most active during the morning 
and evening hours, they rest at midday and night.
That fact gave the idea to introduce a new alignment for the Quenoth elves, 
called "Liminal" (credit for the name goes to ESR's wife iirc).
Liminal units are best during the twilight times of day.
The exception is the Mystic line which starts being Neutral but can advance into chaotic or 
lawful units.

UTBS's day/day/night cycle goes as the following:

1.  First Dawn
2.  First Morning
3.  First Midday
4.  First Afternoon
5.  First Dusk
6.  The Short Dark
7.  Second Dawn
8.  Second Morning
9.  Second Midday
10. Second Afternoon
11. Second Dusk
12. Long Dark one
13. Long Dark two
14. Long Dark three
15. Long Dark four

1.  First Dawn
2.  First Morning
3.  First Midday/Noon
4.  First Afternoon
5.  First Dusk
6.  The Twilight
7.  Second Dawn
8.  Second Morning
9.  Second Midday/Noon
10. Second Afternoon
11. Second Dusk
12. Evening/Nightfall/Sunset
13. Midnight
14. Whatever
15. Aurora

Assumed that the cycle stays as it is that would mean that there are 4 out of 15 twilight day-times in a cycle.
I play with the thought of renaming "The Short Dark" into "The Twilight" (The symbolic image of that daytime suggests that) making
the liminal units superior in 5/15 of the cycle.
Liminal would have disadvantages at midday and during the night.

Let's come back to the quenoth elves:

Appearance:

I consider they would be much darker in skin color than the woodland elves.
The hair color is also darker with a slight red tune in it remembering that it evolved from fair hair.

The ears are less big to avoid the loss of energy during night but still pointy to some degree.
They could be more cat ear like, aligning the cuspid horizontally and maybe haired.
I always liked the idea of ears that can be adjusted/moved like some animals are able to.

The eyes can reflect the fact that they are made for twilight somehow.

The body size is decreased with the same argument as for the ear size.

Ornaments:

Their ornaments are mostly made out of leather, stone or bones like most of the tools they forge.
Those are used to pierce the body (ears, lips?, cheeks). 

Kitty suggested them to have tattoos as well.

Clothes:

Useful are long dark (yes, dark ones. Those filter UV rays best) robes. Maybe not black but Grey/brown/ocher to give a better camouflage.

Weapons:

Since forge-able metal is rare swords are no longer used. 
Instead spears with small blades are common. 

Quenoth elves no longer use bow and arrow since bowstrings can't stand the extreme temperature differences very well.
They hunt with bolas.

Units:

Hunter 

Fighter

Sanddancer

Mystic

Confronted with nature's harshest manifestation the Quenoth bethink of their fairy ancestors.
So the mystics are not manifested in this world as the rest of their folk.
Not being influenced by the environment that much their alignment is neutral 
and the skin is brighter.

Mystic->Moon Shyde

Regenerates at Night.
Weapon: Cold Shock

The Moon Shyde is devoted to the night (what a surprise) 
making her skin even brighter than that of the rest of the mystics.
So her alignment is chaotic and she is more resistant to cold and less resistant to heat.
Her moth wings give her the ability to fly and 
despite their beauty they carry highly abrasive poisonous powder.
If the artist wants they can glow a little.

Mystic->Sibyl
The Sibyl advancement line does keep the neutral alignment of the mystic.

Mystic->Sibyl->Prophetess

Mystic->Sun Sylph

Regenerates at Day.
Weapon: Fire aura 

Wings from a dayactive butterfly.

More resistant to heat/fire and less resistant to cold. 


Culture:

The Quenoth elves live nomadic using tents (but what kind?) but they settle down at oases that have proven to be permanent.
