<Kaleh and friends see the two undead leaders talking to each other; dialogue...>

<Elves from most villages are summoned to guard them>

<Undead that capture villages kill all who live within, thus spawning a WC while removing the village from the map; dialogue; too many vilages lost = loss of the scenario>

<Zhul empowers Garak with fire melee and berserk, firststrike, and magical (when facing either of the undead leaders' champions... the latter two are only bestowed in easy and normal)>

<By turn twelve, Garak will become posessed by one of the undead leaders>

<Once Posessed Garak or the other undead leader is defeated... he dies and the player wins>

<Around turn eight, orcs should arrive in the hills>
