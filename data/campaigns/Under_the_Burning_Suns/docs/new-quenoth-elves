Character Descriptions:

Sand Dancer line (scouts):

The Sand Dancer line is the scout line of the Quenoth elves.

Mystic line (healers):

The Mystic line has abandoned the use of vines, thorns, and faerie fire a long time ago. Some time ago,
they learned how to manipulate their aura, even using it to attack their opponents. There are three
paths that a Mystic can take: mainly focus on her aura-manipulation powers and perfect her healing
(which are associated with the order known as the Children of the Star), unlock the powers of her primordial ancestors (the faeries)
(this is associated with the order known as the Children of the Sun), or gain similar powers to her ancestors, except having
cold-based powers and being chaotic (this is associated with the order known as the Children of the Moon).
Finally, each Mystic carries a blowgun that shoots poisonous darts.

Moon Shyde:

The Moon Shyde is the final form of the <insert name here>. Like its previous form, she can wield
cold aura for melee attacks and <insert name of ultimate ranged attack here>, and instead of a blowgun,
she uses the highly abrasive poisonous powder from her wings to deal pierce damage and to poison her victims.
Finally, she is capable of regenerating at night.

Unlike the Sun Sylph, the Moon Shyde has developed moth wings (that resemble the wings seen on this moth:

night. Like the wings of a real moth, the Moon Shyde's wings are coated with poisonous powder.
