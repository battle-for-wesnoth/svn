<The group gets two elves; three (an L2) if Elyssa isn't with them>

<The group talks about trolls, dwarves, the caves, et cetera>
    - They mention that the trolls are green, a remnant of earlier versions

<Upon going south, a bunch of Giant Ants and a Giant Spider appear; dialogue>

<If the group escapes the spider, then a stalagcite falls and kills it>

<After the group further proceeds, a dying dwarf comes out and references the fact that the trolls are everywhere...>

<The group enters the main chamber... and a bunch of dwarves and trolls spawn; the group must decide to ally with the dwarves or the trolls; dialogue>

<Around turn eleven, if the player allied with the dwarves, some Troll Shamans will unless extremely powerful magic that kills a lot of dwarves; if the trolls were chosen, Thunderguards will come in and blasts a lot of the trolls to death>

<Soon afterwards, dwarfish/troll allies should be sent to the group; dialogue>

<A dwarfish/troll ally will criticize the enemy race upon going near a(n) stone cairn/area with impaled skulls>
    - The message about the stone cairn should probably be changed, as it references the fact that the old
          graphics looked like a real cairn instead of an elaborate stone with an ankh on it set
          on a pile of large stones.

<Eventually, the Cloaked Assassin should appear and try to kill Kaleh again; dialogue>

<After the Cloaked Assassin and the troll/dwarfish leaders are killed... victory...; dialogue>
