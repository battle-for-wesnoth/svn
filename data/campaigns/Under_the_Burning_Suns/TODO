- Choosing the trolls as allies is too hard.

- The whole campaign seems to be unbalanced by being too easy in general.

- The Hunter line's L2 and L3 and the character sprites for Kaleh and Nym are still the
  old ones based on 1.0 and not TCed; they look slightly wrong next to the
  recolored 2.0 sprites.
