- Choosing the trolls as allies is too hard.

- The whole campaign seems to be unbalanced by being too easy in general.

- The Hunter line and the character sprites for Kaleh and Nym are still the
  old ones based on 1.0 and not TCed; they look slightly wrong next to the
  recolored 2.0 sprites.

- The Desert Shyde and Desert Staar haling animations are the wood-elf ones.
  They should be recolored (the difference is subtle, but there).
