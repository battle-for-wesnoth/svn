	unit_description= _ "When light came into the world and gave form to the unknown, fear was forced to retreat into darkness. Since that day, the shadows of the world have held terror for humanity, though it knows not why.

That is a question which is easily answered by a necromancer.

Special Notes: while a unit with the same allegiance as the shadow distracts an enemy, the shadow may strike at the opponent's back, inflicting double damage. Shadows have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water. While they can move through through solid walls, unlike normal Shadows, Ethereal Shadows cannot hide at night."
