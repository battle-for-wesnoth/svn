    unit_description= _ "The purpose of the masks that these creatures wear is unknown, as is the countenance that they obscure. These terrible forms are rarely seen by the living, and those who live to speak of them had no leisure to study their foe.

Special Notes: while a unit with the same allegiance as the Nightgaunt distracts an enemy, the Nightgaunt may strike at the opponent's back, inflicting double damage. Nightgaunts have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water. While they can move through solid walls, unlike normal Nightgaunts, Ethereal Nightgaunts cannot hide at night."
