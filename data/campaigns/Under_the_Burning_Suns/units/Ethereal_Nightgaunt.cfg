Special Notes: while a unit with the same allegiance as the Nightgaunt distracts an enemy, the Nightgaunt may strike at the opponent's back, inflicting double damage. Nightgaunts have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water. While they can move through through solid walls, unlike normal Nightgaunts, Ethereal Nightgaunts cannot hide at night."
