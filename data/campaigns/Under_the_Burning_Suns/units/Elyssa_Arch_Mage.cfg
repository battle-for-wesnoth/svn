	unit_description= _ "The title of Arch Mage is conferred only after a lifetime of study and achievement to match. Arch Magi are often employed in positions of education, or as advisors to those wise enough to seek the fruits of their wisdom. Many tend to wealthy patrons, a profitable enterprise for both as, outside of the occasional task or word of advice, it gives the mage leave to pursue their research undisturbed. Certain others shun civilization, spending their days as hermits, often to study something which most would tend to frown upon.

Though not trained for any sort of combat, if need arises an Arch Mage can unleash the full power of their art, something which is not to be taken lightly.

Special Notes: the arch mage's fireballs are magical, and always have a high chance of hitting an opponent."
