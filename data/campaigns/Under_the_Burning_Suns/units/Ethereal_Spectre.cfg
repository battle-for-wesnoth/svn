The creation of these is no mean feat; the real danger in encountering one is that it is likely only the harbinger of a much more dangerous force that will follow in its wake."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAIN}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SPIRIT}+_"SPECIAL_NOTE^ This unit is able to move through solid stone walls."
