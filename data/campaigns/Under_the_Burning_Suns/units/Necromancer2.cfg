	unit_description= _ "One of the greatest circles of what is considered 'black magic' is the art of necromancy, the terrible ability to awaken the dead with false life. It was a discovery that had terrible ramifications and caused humanity's condemnation of black magic, for it has given fear a vast new arsenal.

This ability, in all aspects, is the first step towards cheating death of its ultimate prize. It is the highest degree of power a dark mage can attain without losing grip on humanity itself, but pales to the lethal power wielded by Liches. Their mortal bodies are also made sturdier by their magic, in contrast to the frail decayed form of a Lich.

Special Notes: the necromancer's ranged attacks are magical and always have a high chance of hitting an opponent. The staff of a necromancer is marked with the plague, and any foe struck down by it will rise again in unlife."
