Trapped within a shroud of vile enchantments, a spirit likens unto the wind in the sails of a ship. The contrivance that results from this prison is an unfailing servant, which can be bound to whatever task their master sees fit.

Special Notes: Ghosts have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water."
