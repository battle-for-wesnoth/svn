	unit_description= _ "These tortured forms of what were once warriors are among the most terrifying things a necromancer can create, for a sword will cleave right through them, as through air itself. What inspires such fear is the thought that these beasts are invincible, a belief that is actually far from the truth.

Because of this, a means was made by which the enchantments that drive these creatures could renew themselves through the very thing which threatened them.

Special Notes: a strike from their blade will drain life from the victim, to renew the wraith. Wraiths have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water. Unlike normal Wraiths, Ethereal Wraiths can also move through solid stone walls."
