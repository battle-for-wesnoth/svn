Hello reader, welcome:

This document provides a proposal (in C++ header-file format) for
a new network API for Wesnoth.

The idea is to act as an intermediary to the ANA API & Library, which
is already under use in the game, but to implement the old API (thought
to work with SDLnet.)

The point is that the new API will use ANA's asynchronous capabilities,
thus reducing CPU usage by the network implementation and simplifying
the code.

An important point is that this new API would shift control in some cases:
e.g. instead of calling every now and then to see if a new client has
connected, the object implementing the corresponding interfaces will get a
call through the corresponding method.

References:

 - ANA : You can look at the ANA source code in src/ana. Some documentation
         about ANA can be found in doc/ana (LaTeX files).
 - asio : ANA is implemented using the boost::asio library, you can find
          documentation for it in boost.org.
 - Code : File network.hpp in trunk holds the current Wesnoth network API.
          This API has many deprecated methods and the implementation
          currently calls for many blocking calls (which is not desired.)

          Files network.cpp and network_worker.cpp hold the current SDLnet
          implementation of this API.

          Files network_ana.cpp and network_manager_ana.Xpp hold the current
          ANA implementation of the API.
