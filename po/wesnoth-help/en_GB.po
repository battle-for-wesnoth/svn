"The Kingdom of Wesnoth is located in the north-central portion of the "
"<ref>dst='great_continent' text='Great Continent'</ref>. Most of the "

"River to the north, the shore of the Great Ocean to the west, the Aethenwood "
"to the <ref>dst='southwest_elven_lands' text='southwest'</ref>, and the "
"Bitter Swamp to the southeast (lower right corner of the main map).\n"
"\n"
"Over the River Aethen, south of Fort Tahn, is a Wesnothian frontier region. "
"It is bounded to the south (off-map) by dense woods of which the Aethenwood "
"may be considered a northernmost extension.\n"
"\n"
"    • Notable cities:\n"

"south road crossing the River Aethen.\n"
"          ◦ Tath: Important fort city north of Dan'Tonk, exerts control over "
"the wilderness country around the east of the Brown Hills and north to the "
"Ford of Abez. \n"

"Clans; the best horses in Wesnoth are bred here.\n"
"          ◦ Estmark Hills: Largish range rising south of the Great River and "
"east of the Weldyn River. The northernmost portion, nearest the River "
"Weldyn, has at various times been settled by Wesnothians, but the Kingdom's "
"control is tenuous at best and banditry is common.\n"
"          ◦ Glyn's Forest: Sometimes known as the Royal Forest, named for "
"one of Haldric II's sons\n"
"          ◦ Gray Woods: Large forest in the heart of the wilds of Wesnoth, "
"located between Carcyn and Aldril and generally considered to be haunted\n"
