"Two terrains have properties which have already been described; namely "
"villages and castles. However, the properties of most terrains are more "
"subtle, and have to do with the advantages and disadvantages different units "
"have when they move onto them. The first property of a terrain is the number "
"of move points it takes each unit to move through the hex. The second "
"property is the defense that the terrain gives units standing on it. This is "
"a percentage which determines the unit's chance to be hit on that terrain. "
"For example, many elves have 70% defense in forest, and are therefore hit on "
"average 30% of the time."
