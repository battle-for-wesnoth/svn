"This will go much faster if you don't interrupt me. Now, as I was saying the "
"Empire of Wesnoth was very learned in the magical arts and had vast "
"repositories of knowledge. Back then there was only one sun in the sky, the "
"sun you call Sela. But the king decreed that he would raise a second sun "
"into the heavens, to lengthen their days and shorten the darkness. All the "
"mages, sorcerers and wise men came together and cast a mountain into the sky "
"and made it glow as bright as the sun. They sent this second sun, who you "
"call Naia, hurling through the sky so that there was only a few hours of "
"dark each night. Though some had called the attempt foolish, it was a "
"resounding success and stood as a tribute to the power and might of the "

"complacent and the ranks of mages who still trained hard to harness the "
"magical arts had decreased greatly. Still the king believed he was all-"
"powerful and would not listen to the mages' protests. So, seeking to "
"duplicate their ancestors' previous success, the mages tried to lift a "
"second mountain into the sky. But a great evil befell them that day; their "
"power failed and the mountain crashed down onto the human's capital, "
