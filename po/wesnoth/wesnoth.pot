"Drakes are large, winged and fire-breathing creatures, reminiscent of true "
"dragons. On average, an adult drake stands around three meters tall and "
"easily weighs more than a man and a horse combined. Their skin is made up of "
"hard scales, resistant to most physical strikes except piercing and cold "
"damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances "
"quickly. However, their sheer weight and bulk limits their flight ability "
"somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of "
"terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in "
"order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, they "
"are still quite clumsy creatures and surprisingly slow in combat. This, "
"combined with their large size, renders them easy targets for those who dare "
"attack them.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are inherently magical creatures, with a mysterious internal fire "
"fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their "
"kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their "
"remains in to ashes. Their internal fire is also their greatest weakness; it "
"makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical "
"nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled manner. "
"While the magic imbued within a drake's body enables it to spit fire and "
"gives it life, they have no willful control over its functions of this "
"magic.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Drakes are a relatively warlike race and their societies can be best "
"described as cultured martial societies. The core of a drake tribe is a "
"small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected - or simply "
"feared - leader who rules the society with an iron fist. Every drake is "
"expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey their "
"superiors and command their lessers. Entry to the ruling elite is only "
"possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, "
"which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is established. The "
"use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, "
"seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain of moss "
"and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. The only technology drakes "
"value is armour- and weapon-smithing, and neither know or need other science "
"and culture besides this. However the few implements they do fashion are "
"almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by those produced in the finest "
"Dwarven foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are hatched from eggs and usually live naturally between 20 to 30 "
"years. Death in battle is the most preferred way for a drake to leave this "
"world. Unlike the elder members of other races, drakes naturally grow more "
"aggressive and reckless towards the ends of their natural lives, perhaps to "
"help ensure their place in the heroic legends of their kind.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Geography'</header>\n"
"Drakes originate from the island of Morogor in the Great Ocean. However, "
"since the island has been slowly sinking for centuries, and colonies of "
"drakes have slowly spread to the Great Continent. Drakes tend make their "
"homes in mountain caverns near volcanoes to protect their eggs, hatchings "
"and forges. While drakes naturally prefer warmth, their internal fire is "
"more than capable of sustaining them even in a relatively cold climate, a "
"feature which has allowed them to populate even some of the mountains of the "
"far north of the Great Continent."

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "
"warriors. Considered as the third oldest race on the great continent after "
"the elves and trolls, their early history is shrouded in mystery. Legends "
"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the continent’s history since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves started allowing some humans, mostly dissidents "
"and outlaws from the Crown of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas. Later, when threatened by the Orcs, the dwarves and "
"their human allies formed The Alliance of Knalga to defend their common "
"realm.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves are of small stature by human measure, but they are by no means "
"fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected "
"throughout the continent for their prowess in battle. In addition, dwarves "
"are known for their calculating intellects and superb craftsmanship. Dwarven "
"smiths are renowned for their deadly weapons and heavy armor. These "
"accouterments are unrivaled in quality, possibly only matched by those "
"produced by drake armourers. Their intelligence and natural inquisitiveness "
"has also made them the most technically advanced race on the continent. One "
"of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a mysterious powder that "
"produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf "
"warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given "
"their technological inclinations, many dwarves tend to distrust magic users. "
"However some practice a form of magic based on the engraving of runes. "
"Called runesmiths, they use these carvings to enchant items in order to "
"augment certain aspects of their natures."

"Compared to humans, elves are somewhat taller, more agile but less sturdy. "
"They have slightly pointy ears, pale skin and usually blond hair. Few "
"differences between humans and elves are more pronounced than the latter’s "
"unusually long life - most, unless claimed by illness, accident or war, live "
"a full two centuries. While some elves possessing a high magical aptitude "
"have been known to live an additional full century, most elves begin to grow "
"physically frail approaching their twentieth decade and pass away within a "
"few decades after. Elves are naturally imbued with magic to a small degree. "
"Though most are unable to channel it directly, its latent presence gives "

"normal beings would find astonishing. Those elves that learn to wield this "
"power in more general ways can become truly formidable in its use. Many "
"choose to use their gift to heal others.\n"
"\n"
"Elves spend much of their time honing their talents and skills. Those not "
"adept at the magical arts typically devote their time honing their physical "
"skills. As a result, elves excel at archery, which is perhaps their most "
"important method of warfare. Most elvish troops carry a bow and no other "
"race can rival their archers in speed and accuracy. All elves also share an "
"unexplained affection for unspoiled nature. They often feel uncomfortable in "
"open unvegetated spaces, which leads them to make their homes in the forests "
"of the Great Continent, such as Aethenwood in the southwest and Wesmere in "
"the northwest. Elves are the eldest race of the continent, with the possible "
"exception of trolls. Many of their settlements cannot be reliably dated, "
"undoubtedly having existed for over a millennium."

"never travels long or lives alone in groups smaller than half a dozen.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Almost every orc are a member of a tribe or a clan. Relations between "
"neighbouring tribes are usually violent, except in cases of a mutual enemy "
"threatens their existence or prospects of great plunder override mutual "
"animosity. Occasionally, a single strong chieftain may emerge to lead "
"multiple tribes from time to time, usually through intimidation of "
"followers. An orc tribe in times of peace tends to focus almost solely on "
"strengthening itself in preparation for the next armed conflict. Orcs are "
"known to possess a crude system of writing - usually in blood - although "
"it's most commonly used to trade insults or threats among tribal leaders.\n"
"\n"
"Orc societies are based on little else but strength; might makes right, and "
"a leader leads and survives only as long as no one manages to wrest the "
"title from him. A constant struggle for power simmers among potential tribal "
"chiefs. An orcish leader rarely lives more than a handful of years to enjoy "
"his absolute authority before being killed for his position - although "
"history knows some notable exceptions. Orcs hold no particular honour code "
"and while undisputable raw strength is usually the preferred method of "
"displaying power, assassination, poisoning and backstabbing are completely "
"viable means to further one's own goals.\n"
"\n"
"Orcs mostly live in rural areas, often in foothills or mountainous regions, "
"sometimes in caves. They grow no crops nor keep livestock, but are competent "
"hunters as a result of their physical stature and brutality. Due to their "
"large numbers they are capable of hunting an area virtually clean of "
"anything larger than rodents in relatively short period of time. Due to this "
"and their unstable leadership, orcish tribes tend to lead a semi-nomadic "
"lifestyle, never settling in one region for too long. The larger tribes may "
"establish themselves firmly in an area for years or even decades and build "
"large encampments almost resembling cities, but even these are easily "
"dismantled and abandoned if there is a need to relocate the horde.\n"
"\n"
"The oldest known orcs have been around 50 to 60 years of age, but very few "

"end either in war or by the hand of one of their kin. The oldest orcs are "
"often shamans, which are perhaps the only ones most of their kind sees as "
"being trustworthy and neutral. The origins of this custom are unknown, as "
"the shamans do not directly contribute much to orcish societies but only act "
"as advisors - not something orcs tend to otherwise tolerate. Shamans are in "
"many ways the opposite of most other orcs: they are often physically "
"withered and frail in comparison and lack skill in battle. Despite their "
"reliance on raw strength, not nearly all orcs are destined to grow to "
"possess any. Many orcs are born smaller and weaker than the rest, and "
"already almost as newborns are put in their place by their stronger "
"siblings. The stronger ones will routinely grab most of the food and thus "
"grow stronger still, while their weaker siblings do not. Many of these "
"individuals tend to specialize in other skills, like archery or "

"Trolls are ancient creatures, one of the oldest known races known to inhabit "

"water, and thus they have little incentive to pursue much besides protection "
"from those who are hostile towards them. This in turn means they rarely have "
"to worry about anything and can spend much of their time sleeping or in "
"contemplation. Trolls have a curious affinity with nature. They do not "
"relate with living things like elves do, but instead with earth and stone. "
"They are also somewhat curious of their surroundings and many younger whelps "
"even enjoy traveling and seeing the world. As trolls grow older they tend to "

"\n"
"Trolls are seen by many as being little more than a yet another race of "
