msgid ""
"A terrifying, monstrous bastion of strength, a Troll Warrior brings to fore "
"all the tales that have been told of their race's terrifying power.  "
"Wielding massive hammers that could knock a house off its foundation, and "
"able to absorb a seemingly endless rash of punishment, Troll Warriors are "
"capable of singlehandedly changing the strategies of an enemy commander they "
"face.  A troll warrior is not something brought down by one man, but by a "
"whole group of them, fighting desperately against this hideous strength "
"borne before them.  That which causes the most terror about a troll warrior, "
"is not their appearance, or their power, but the fact that one brought even "
"within an inch of its life will shortly return to its full strength if it is "
"not truly sent to death.\n"
"\n"
"Usage:\n"
"Troll Warriors fight well on rough, rocky terrain, especially at night.  "
"Though vulnerable to archers and spellcasters, especially in open terrain, "
"the raw power of a Troll Warrior makes them a foe that generally must be "
"brought down by several enemies.  There are few enemies which can engage "
"them in one-on-one combat without a great danger of being killed on the same "
"turn.  Their regeneration allows them to cure poison, and heal wounds "
"without the aid of a nearby village.  Their relative weakness during "
"daylight hours is a liability, though a Troll Warrior is still very powerful "
"during the day."

msgid ""
"The word 'whelp,' applied even to fearsome animals like wolves and lions, "
"brings to mind images of frail, helpless, and even 'cute' creatures, so "
"young they can hardly stand on their own feet.  Given the nature of Trolls, "
"however, a Troll 'whelp' already possesses the terrifying strength native to "
"their race.  Troll whelps stumble about with bodies bigger than grown men, "
"and with strength to match.  Their uncanny regeneration, and stone-like "
"skin, make them monstrous opponents, especially on their favored ground in "
"the mountains and hills from whence they came.  The only reassurance one has "
"in fighting a troll whelp is their slow speed, and the fact that they have "
"not grown to their full strength ... yet.\n"
"\n"
"Usage:\n"
"Troll Whelps fight well on rough, rocky terrain, especially at night.  They "
"are vulnerable to archers, especially in open terrain, and should always "
"have a healthy fear of spellcasters in all terrain.  They are quite powerful "
"against brittle foes, like skeletons, and quite weak against well armored or "
"naturally resilient enemies, such as their woodland counterpart, the wose.  "
"Their regeneration allows them to cure poison and heal wounds without the "
"aid of a nearby village.  Their relatively slow speed is a liability, as is "
"their weakness during daylight hours."
