"Some magi, as they learn about the world around them, and learn the truth of "

"skills they have been given to the good of all. After their ordination, they "
"often travel the world, ministering to sickness and injury.\n"

"always has a high chance of hitting an opponent. This light does tremendous "
"damage to the undead, and can even damage living creatures. White magi are "
