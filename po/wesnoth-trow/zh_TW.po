"To the southwest lay the Midlands. These were prosperous kingdoms, nestled "
"between hill and forest. They served as the bread basket of a people, as "
"well as a valuable source of both lumber and gemstones. These kingdoms fed "
"the city of Southbay, the largest city on the Isle. Although, with this "
"coming of the orcs the midlands are probably a barren waste by now."

"The river road follows the Isle's greatest river to the southeast. This road "
"leads to the Isle's second largest city, Clearwater Port. It would likely "
"have been the Isle's largest city save for the events of the Wesfolk War. "
"The Lich-Lords befouled much of the land around the river during the course "
"of a great battle. Now the swamp is home to a Wesfolk-imitating cult."

"Apparently the island that King Haldric and his crew are approaching was at "
