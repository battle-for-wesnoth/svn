# I have translated Wesnoth into two chinese characters counting from the last four characters.
# Wesnoth = mid(TranslatedString, 9,2)
# As there are no direct Chinese word for it, I go for the sound.
# Using "Wei" as the Hanyu Pinying, I choose this one out of probably more than fifty characters.
# The primary reason is, to Chinese people, "Wei" was once a great state during the era of the Chinese warlords.
# (The well known book: Romance Of The Three Kindom Classic wrote of this history.)
# Hence, this word "Wei" conveys to the Chinese memories of war, strategies, betrayal, victories and defeat.
# The word "nuo" chosen can and has been be used in names. Hence I combine these two characters to describe game Wesnoth, one of war, strategy, victories and defeat.

# Here, I translated the primary character Konrad into "kong lie" (Hanyu Pinyin)
# There was once a very famous Chinese Poet name "Kong Zhi". Much of his works stills flow among the Chinese today. Another great man was written in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" (see comments at "Fight to gain back the throne of Wesnoth, of which you are the legitimate heir."). This man was "Kong Ming" -- Known to be the greatest Chinese Strategist. He also became the Prime Minister of his state.
# Hence, I chose this word because, Konrad was suppose to be a great leader and King. Also, his long association with the Elves should have made him wise. Hence, Using the same word as the great men, many Chinese can associate him with the great sages of the past.

# Chinese can be spoken in two manner: Poetic and common.
# Usually, those with higher social status speaks peotically, much like the Royals in the West speaks in verse.
# These are my Character Analysis of Li'sar. (Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong. These are the impressions I get after playing the game many many times.)
# 1) She was brought up in the Royal family, probably treated with fine education by great tutors of her time.
# 2) Her mother's diabolical influence though has not rubbed into her, has however, influence her character. She was caught between the "good" and the "evil".
# 3) Though not spoken, she has actually fallen in love with Konrad in the tunnel, probably during the "Hasty Alliance" episode.
# 4) She "matures" after seeking refuge with the Elves, and joining the Elvian Council.
# 5) After Konrad expresses his love for her, she blossoms into a true lady, well respected and loved.
# With such, I decided to translate speeches of Li'sar in this manner:
# 1) Her speech should reflect her royal upbringing, yet tempered with arrogance, especially with subordinates.
# 2) Her arrogance will be coupled with a little flirtation after "Hasty Alliance" when directed to Konrad.
# 3) When speaking to other characters, she will be rude before Elvian Council, but after, sweet.

# This is my Character Analysis of Konrad. (Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong. These are the impressions I get after playing the game many many times.)
# 1) Brought up in the Elvian society from infancy, Konrad was for certainty, a man of unparallel wisdom.
# 2) Coupled with council and guidance from Delfador (a wise man even praised by the Elve Lords) who was a veteran in warfare, Konrad no doubt has acquired much leadership skills from him.
# 3) Having missed out femanine association from the Human race, Li'sar has proven to be a rose to his eyes. Surely, his speeches will reflect such when speaking with her. (No wonder the Parandra tease him into staying with the elves instead of joining Li'sar in her quest).
# With such, I will translate Konrad's speeches in this manner.
# 1) Since Delfador is his mentor, with speech in his presence will be respectful and peotic
# 2) His speech against enemies will be short, commanding and direct.
# 3) His speech with Li'sar will be common and child-like. [That's me when I first fell in love ;-)]

# 1) Though of Elvian origin, Kalenz have been a warrior all his/her life. Rising to Elvian Lord has been a long and tedious journey.

# Character Analysis of Delfador
# (I might be wrong. So correct me if necessary as I translate his speeches based on these attributes.)
# 1. A very wise and loyal man. One who during his younger times, fought bravely, conquering even the world of death. This made him a person rich in life experience and a true veteran in war.
# 2. During his older age, he protects the "heir" alongside the Elves. Although remorse over his past, he attempts to amend the future. A manifestation of true courage and humility.
# 3. Though gone through many warfares, his failure in protecting the real Konrad has crippled his ability to become a leader again.
# Nevertheless, his loyalty has made him an invaluable asset to the young leader he would serve.
# With such I like to translate his speeches in HttT with texts expressing true wisdom, yet full of humility and modesty. I will made the reader feel that he is a person who will not only win wars, but also one who will win hearts.
# (I will attempt to made his speeches, especially the part where he reveal Konrad's true identity, poetic. If recited aloud, his words will touch hearts.)

# ********************************************************
# What Chinese film producers think of "Taoist"
# ********************************************************
# In many Hong Kong/Taiwan movies,
# 1. Taoist in ghost movies ward off evils spirits, like that of White Mages.
# 2. In non-ghost, Kung Fu movies, Taoist possess great, destructive powers (full of pyro-technic explosive effects), like red-mages.
# (They however, do not have much on Teleportation. Perhaps difficult to film and not probably interesting. Many Taoist, hovever, can fly though. Wonder if they can be interpolate to mean teleportation or not.)
# Note: Many Chinese Kung Fu movies (non-mythological) based their works on the philosophy coined by a famous writer called Jin Yung. Much like many Medivial Characters stem from "Dungeons & Dragons", many Chinese philosophical characters stem from his works (while many other mythological characters like Dragons, stem from Chinese myths).

# This is the first occurance of the word "Lawful" in Wesnoth context.
# There is a direct translation "he fa". But in Chinese, this applies to people who obeys the law.
# It is contextually wrong for Wesnoth. Hence I attempts to coin a term (perhaps can be patented for Wesnoth): "Shun Yang Zhe". This is an extract from the Taoist theory of "Ying and Yang" well known among Chinese.
# (I am sure we will become a laughing stock if I translate "Lawful" into one who obeys Law and "Chaotic" into one who disobey Law. Reason: This is a game involving war. Civil law does not apply. In Wesnoth, even "Chaotic" has the rights to win and stay in the territory, like the Dark Hordes.)
# Hence I recommend: "Lawful" = "Shun Yang Zhe", "Chaotic" = "Shun Ying Zhe", "Neutral" = "Ying Yang He Zhe". I think most Chinese will like these terms. Reason: One with "Ying Yang" balanced has no problem with day or night. (Exactly what a neutral unit is). A "Shun Yang Zhe" (Literally one who favours "Yang" (Transliterate: "Sun", day) will like day and same goes for "Shun Ying Zhe" (One who favours "Ying" (transliterate: darkness, night) ) will favour night more!
