msgid ""
"Rarely seen even by elves, the Wose is an order of creature about which "
"little is known. The elves are the source of most of this knowledge; they "
"know that these beings are not descended from trees, despite the similarity "
"in form, and they know that a wose is more closely tied to the faerie world "
"than the elves themselves, though in a different way. The motives and "
"workings of their kind are unknown, though most subscribe to the obvious "
"theory that woses are dedicated wardens of the natural world.\n"
"\n"
"Woses are utterly unwarlike, but possess a great strength. They are, "
"however, neither used to, nor quick at moving around."
