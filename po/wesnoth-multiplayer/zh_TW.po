"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "

"在納迦，有個勇敢的戰士叫 Rilhon, heard tell of a fabulous treasure that had "
"been lost in these watery caves- a spear whose head was said to have been "
"fashioned from the tooth of Chak'kso Ney'yks, an Elder Basilisk slain long "
"ago by the Elvish hero, Eloralduil. According to the legend, the weapon "
"rested somewhere on the bottom of this very lake (Ruaskkolin Lake, named for "
"a well-known Sea Serpent who made it his home). Having prepared himself for "
"battle with the Serpent, Rilhon met with two rather large surprises. The "
"first was the petrified form of Ruaskkolin the Serpent. The second was the "
"very-much-alive Chak'kso Ney'yks, who was, oddly enough, in possession of "
"all of his teeth.\n"
