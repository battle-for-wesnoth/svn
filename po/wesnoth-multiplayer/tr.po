"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "
"the Elders of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan (translation: ''The Hunts-Foes-In-"
"Boiling-Rivers Clan''). The Elders were preparing to make war on a human "
"outpost, and were in great need of the powerful magics of Oxsrrsk, a Saurian "
"Mystic who had last been seen heading in the direction of Ruaskkolin Lake. "
"Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound "
"scroll that had apparently been dropped into a small crevice in the cave "
"floor. He opened the scroll and read a brief passage from the middle of the "
"text: ''After he was bound and cast from the Upper World, Chak'kso's enraged "
"spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on "
"certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ''pathways of stone'' "
"that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage "
"altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into "
"implements of Chak'kso's hatred.'' Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on "
"the task at hand. Thinking that perhaps the Elders could find some way to "
"restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue "
"back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having "
"traveled far from the lake, Xikkrisx set the statue down inside of a small "
"cave, and lay down to rest. He was awoken by a bone-chilling roar."

"Chak'kso was believed to have been a powerful demigod of the Under Reaches, "
"described as a ''great demon of the earth'' in the Elvish Histories. "
"According to these histories, Chak'kso had once sought to transform all life "
"on the planet to stone; so great was his hatred for creatures of flesh. He "

"following his banishment (to a realm far below the surface of the world) a "

"Basilisks (as they came to be known) wreaked havoc on the world of the "
"living, turning thousands to stone. One by one, and at great cost, the "
"Basilisks were defeated. All, it would seem, but one; the Basilisk known as "
"''The Ney'yks,'' or ''The Eldest Child,'' in the modern tongue. Supremely "
"convinced of his ability to locate and bind this powerful creature into his "
"service, Oxsrrsk set out on his journey..."
