To compile the game, for the source version, type 'make' from the game's root directory.

To run the game, type ./wesnoth from the game's root directory. The current directory must be the game's root directory when running the game. This is a limitation that will be addressed in later versions.

If you want to run the game in a window, use the option -windowed at the command line. The game may have trouble running on X-windows on a display set to anything other than 16 bits per pixel.

Please report any problems with installing or running the game to me.
