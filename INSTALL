PREREQUISITES

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions) to build Wesnoth:

 libsdl1.2
 libsdl-image1.2
 libsdl-mixer1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf2.0
 libsdl-net

These libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org


SOURCECODE

You can get it here: http://www.wesnoth.org/downloads or check http://www.ventu.info/wesnoth/?WesnothCVS


COMPILING

First untar the package:

 $ tar xfzv wesnoth-0.x.tar.gz 
	  
then

 $ cd wesnoth-0.x

followed by

 $ make

and finally

 $ ./wesnoth 

to run the program. Have fun.


RELOCATING DATA

There is a way to get Wesnoth to locate its data and have the data files not under the executable. You just add the preprocessor symbol WESNOTH_PATH to point to the path the data is at. So when compiling add the flag,

 -DWESNOTH_PATH=\"/usr/share/wesnoth\" 

and Wesnoth will look for its data under /usr/share/wesnoth.


NOTE:

Users compiling CVS sources should 'make clean' before 'make' after any tree update.
