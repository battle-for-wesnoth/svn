Prerequisites:

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions) to build Wesnoth: 

 libsdl1.2
 libsdl-image1.2
 libsdl-mixer1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-net
 libfreetype2

SDL* libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org . libfreetype can be found
at http://www.freetype.org/ .

You will also need to have a working installation of gettext to build the
translations.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the CVS repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
CVS, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59) and automake (>= 1.8).

Sourcecode:

You can get it here:

 http://www.wesnoth.org/downloads


Compiling:

First untar the package:
  	
 $ tar xfzv wesnoth-0.x.tar.gz 

then
  	
 $ cd wesnoth-0.x

followed by
  	
 $ ./configure

compile with

 $ make
	  

Installing:
  	
 $ make install
	  

Updating:

 When updating wesnoth (e.g. redoing "configure" with new switches, or updating from CVS) clean the tree first with:

 $ make clean
