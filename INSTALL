Prerequisites:

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions) to build Wesnoth: 

 libsdl1.2
 libsdl-image1.2
 libsdl-mixer1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf2.0
 libsdl-net

These libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org


Sourcecode:

You can get it here:

 http://www.wesnoth.org/downloads
 http://www.ventu.info/wesnoth/?WesnothCVS


Compiling:

First untar the package:
  	
 $ tar xfzv wesnoth-0.x.tar.gz 

then
  	
 $ cd wesnoth-0.x

followed by
  	
 $ make
	  

Installing:
  	
 $ make install
	  

Relocating Data:

By default game is installed to /usr/local. There is a way to get Wesnoth to locate its data and have the data files not under the executable. Variables with defaults are:

 DESTDIR=/usr/local # base path for game binaries, pixmaps, and man pages
 DATADIR=/usr/local # base path for wesnoth-data
 SERVDIR=/usr/local # base path for server-binary

These are given as args to make. To install wesnoth to /opt...

 $ make DESTDIR=/opt/wesnoth-0.5.1-cvs DATADIR=/opt/wesnoth-0.5.1-cvs SERVDIR=/opt/wesnoth-server-0.5.1-cvs
 $ make install DESTDIR=/opt/wesnoth-0.5.1-cvs DATADIR=/opt/wesnoth-0.5.1-cvs SERVDIR=/opt/wesnoth-server-0.5.1-cvs


Note:

Users compiling CVS sources should 'make clean' before 'make' after any tree update.
